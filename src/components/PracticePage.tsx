            <li>Practice Movement Pattern Recognition with visual diagrams only - no text descriptions (10 randomized questions including promoted pieces!)</li>
            <li>Try Promotion Matching to learn which pieces can be promoted and what they become</li>
            <li>Practice regularly to build muscle memory</li>
            <li>Focus on understanding movement patterns</li>
            <li>Don't worry about speed - accuracy comes first</li>
