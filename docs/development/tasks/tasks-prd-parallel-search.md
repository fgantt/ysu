# Task List: Parallel Search Implementation

This task list is derived from the PRD for adding parallel search to the Shogi engine using YBWC algorithm with work-stealing.

## Relevant Files

- `Cargo.toml` - Add `rayon` dependency for thread pool management
- `src/search/parallel_search.rs` - New module containing parallel search engine implementation

- `src/search/search_engine.rs` - Modify SearchEngine to support parallel context creation
- `src/search/search_engine.rs` (IterativeDeepening) - Integrate parallel search into iterative deepening
- `src/usi.rs` - Add USI_Threads option registration and handling
- `src/lib.rs` - Update handle_setoption to support USI_Threads configuration
- `src/types.rs` - Add ParallelSearchConfig to EngineConfig if needed
- `tests/parallel_search_tests.rs` - Unit tests for parallel search components
- `tests/parallel_search_integration_tests.rs` - Integration tests for parallel search with all features
- `tests/parallel_search_correctness_tests.rs` - Correctness tests comparing with single-threaded

### Notes

- All test files should be placed in the `tests/` directory at the project root
- Use `cargo test` to run all tests, `cargo test parallel_search` to run parallel search tests specifically
- Use `cargo bench` to run performance benchmarks
- The parallel search should be transparent to existing code - primarily integrated through `IterativeDeepening::search()`

## Group B Performance Results (Benchmarks)

- Benchmark: `parallel_root_search` (depth 3/5/6), time limit 1000ms for depth 5/6, threads {1,2,4,8}
- Environment: same machine as development runs; Criterion defaults; values below are mean times (lower is better) with approximate speedups vs 1-thread baselines.

- Depth 5 (mean):
  - 1 thread: 1.427 s
  - 2 threads: 0.919 s (≈1.55×)
  - 4 threads: 0.946 s (≈1.51×)
  - 8 threads: 0.917 s (≈1.56×)

- Depth 6 (mean / notes):
  - 1 thread: 1.405 s
  - 2 threads: 0.918 s (≈1.53×)
  - 4 threads: 0.946 s (≈1.49×)
  - 8 threads: 1.213 s mean (median ≈0.922 s → ≈1.52×); mean impacted by outliers, median stable

- Changes that improved scaling:
  - Shared transposition table across all workers (reads + writes) for better reuse and PV consistency
  - Batching (`with_min_len`) to reduce scheduling overhead; per-task search contexts for Send safety
  - Minor contention profiling added to work-stealing queue

- Takeaway: At deeper depths (5/6), parallel speedups stabilize around ~1.5× on 2–8 threads with current configuration; further gains likely require additional parallelization within deeper nodes and contention reductions.

Additional runs (depth 7/8, stricter TT gating + YBWC thresholds):

- Depth 7 (mean): 1t 1.947s; 2t 2.560s (0.76×); 4t 2.222s (0.88×); 8t 1.728s (1.13×)
- Depth 8 (mean): 1t 2.287s; 2t 3.608s (0.63×); 4t 2.302s (0.99×); 8t 2.696s (0.85×)

Notes:
- Results indicate regression at higher depths with current thresholds; likely overhead-bound (including verbose USI info during benches) and insufficient deep-node parallelization.
- Next steps: add a silent bench mode to suppress USI info lines, increase YBWC granularity deeper in the tree, and continue TT write gating refinements.

Quick re-run (env-config benches: depths 7/8, threads 1/4):
- Baseline (scaling 6,4,2; branch 20; siblings 6):
  - Depth 7: 1t ≈1.951s; 4t ≈2.222s (0.88×)
  - Depth 8: 1t ≈2.309s; 4t ≈2.300s (~1.00×)
  - Metrics: ybwc_batches=0, ybwc_siblings=0 (inner YBWC not triggering)
- Aggressive (scaling 5,3,2; branch 12; siblings 8; tt gating 8,10,1024):
  - Depth 7: 1t ≈1.960s; 4t ≈2.260s (0.87×)
  - Depth 8: 1t ≈2.325s; 4t ≈2.351s (0.99×)
  - Metrics: ybwc_batches=0, ybwc_siblings=0

Takeaway: With current bench position/time limits, deep-node YBWC is not being exercised; scaling remains ≤1× at 4 threads on depths 7/8. Plan: (a) add deeper positions or increase allowed depth/time; (b) lower YBWC activation depth further and/or widen conditions for sibling batching; (c) explore per-depth dynamic sibling caps and stricter TT exact-only gating to reduce contention.
