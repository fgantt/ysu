# Tasks: Material Evaluation Modernization

**Parent PRD:** `task-11.0-material-evaluation-review.md`  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** In Planning

---

## Overview

Task 11.0 focuses on bringing the material evaluation subsystem in line with the commitments documented in the PRD review. The current implementation delivers deterministic tapered scoring for board and hand pieces, but it suffers from dead configuration flags, hard-coded value tables, minimal observability, and linear board scans that block further optimization. This task list breaks the remediation work into actionable sub-projects that can be delivered incrementally while preserving engine stability.

### Objectives

1. **Honor configuration promises.** The `use_research_values` flag must become functional, and material evaluators instantiated via integration layers must reflect runtime configuration.
2. **Unlock tuning workflows.** Value tables should be externalized so that tuning pipelines and tooling can experiment without source changes.
3. **Improve visibility.** Enhanced statistics and telemetry are required to understand material contributions during search and tuning.
4. **Prepare for performance work.** Identify and implement optimizations that reduce redundant board scans and enable future incremental evaluation.
5. **Strengthen validation.** Expand tests and benchmarks to cover Shogi-specific scenarios (hand pieces, impasse boundaries, promotions) and to track regression risk.

### Delivery Phases

| Phase | Focus | Target Timeline | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Phase 1** | Configuration enablement + integration wiring | 1 sprint | Config tooling, evaluation integration |
| **Phase 2** | Value-set externalization + telemetry | 1–2 sprints | Phase 1 completion |
| **Phase 3** | Performance optimizations + extended validation | 2+ sprints | Phases 1–2, profiling data |
| **Phase 4** | Stretch goals & documentation polish | As needed | Prior phases |

## Open Questions & Risks

1. **Hand-value heuristics:** Do we need rank/file-aware modifiers now, or can we defer until telemetry highlights issues?  
2. **Value-set provenance:** Who owns the canonical research vs. classic tables? Define the update process and review gate.  
3. **Hot reload complexity:** Is live material config switching required in production, or can it remain a development-only feature?  
4. **Incremental evaluation roadmap:** Should incremental material scoring be part of this task or spun into a new initiative (Task 12.x)?  
5. **Compatibility:** How do we ensure older configuration files fail fast when referencing removed presets?

Risks should be addressed during implementation planning; unresolved questions require owner assignments before Phase 2 work commences.

## Completion Notes

### Task 1.0 — Value-Set Selection Enablement

- **Implementation:** Added `MaterialValueSet` abstraction with classic and research presets, metadata tags, and per-piece tapered tables. `MaterialEvaluator` now selects the appropriate preset based on `MaterialEvaluationConfig`, with graceful hand-value fallbacks when entries are omitted.
- **Testing:** Expanded material evaluator unit tests to cover preset toggling, value-set differentials, and promoted piece fallbacks. Introduced position-based regression ensuring evaluations diverge between presets.
- **Documentation:** Updated `ENGINE_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` to explain preset selection semantics for `use_research_values`.

### Task 2.0 — Configuration Propagation & Lifecycle

- **Implementation:** `IntegratedEvaluationConfig` now owns `MaterialEvaluationConfig`, and both `IntegratedEvaluator` and `OptimizedEvaluator` hydrate their material evaluators from it. Runtime updates rebuild material evaluators, refresh optimized paths, clear evaluation/phase caches, and reset telemetry counters.
- **Testing:** Added unit coverage for `MaterialEvaluator::apply_config` plus integration tests that toggle presets at runtime, assert cache invalidation, score divergence, and material statistics resets.
- **Notes:** A dedicated handle struct was unnecessary—the existing `RefCell`-backed evaluator provides safe runtime swapping. Configuration inputs remain validated by design because the preset flag maps to compiled-in value sets.

### Task 3.0 — Externalized Material Value Sets

- **Implementation:** Added `MaterialValueSet` Serde bindings with JSON/TOML parsing, external loader/saver utilities, and manifest-backed default assets under `resources/material/`. `MaterialEvaluationConfig` gains an optional `values_path` allowing runtime selection of custom tables with graceful fallback and logging.
- **Testing:** Introduced standalone loader tests covering custom JSON round-trips, built-in asset loading, and fallback behavior. Leveraged integration tests to ensure alternate presets influence evaluation outcomes.
- **Documentation:** Updated configuration guidance and task plan to explain external file workflows; defaults ship with research/classic presets for tuning teams.

### Task 4.0 — Observability & Telemetry Expansion

- **Implementation:** Expanded `MaterialEvaluationStats` to accumulate per-piece board and hand contributions, hand-piece balance, phase-weighted totals, and preset usage counters. Integrated phase-weight recording within `IntegratedEvaluator` and surfaced a material telemetry snapshot alongside existing tapered/phase/performance data with debug logging.
- **Testing:** Added unit tests covering contribution accounting and preset usage, plus integration tests that assert material telemetry emission and statistics resets after configuration changes.
- **Documentation:** Captured telemetry workflow updates in the task plan and ensured search debug output exposes the new material metrics.

### Task 5.0 — Performance & Scalability Enhancements

- **Implementation:** Added the opt-in `enable_fast_loop` flag that switches board/hand traversal to popcount-driven aggregation, plus the `MaterialDelta` API for incremental reuse of existing scores. Statistics instrumentation now understands deltas and keeps preset usage synchronized across optimized paths.
- **Testing:** Extended unit coverage to verify delta parity and contribution accounting; added a feature-gated cross-check (`cargo test --features material_fast_loop material_delta`) to compare legacy vs. fast loops; integration tests confirm telemetry resets after config updates.
- **Benchmarks:** Expanded `material_evaluation_performance_benchmarks.rs` with heavy board, hand-inventory, promoted, and ablation scenarios. Latest run shows board-heavy evaluations dropping from ~233 ns to ~41 ns (~6.1×) when the fast loop is enabled. Results are logged in `docs/development/tasks/engine-performance-analysis.md`.
- **Documentation:** Updated configuration guides with the new flag, captured profiling notes in the performance analysis document, and recorded rollout guidance (opt-in default, parity validation workflow) in the task plan.

### Task 6.0 — Test Coverage & Edge Case Validation

- **Implementation:** Added dedicated edge-case tests covering massive hand inventories, promoted capture demotion flow, impasse thresholds, and stats resets; introduced a reusable regression harness with curated positions and expected tapered scores.
- **Testing:** New suites (`material_edge_case_tests`, `material_regression_tests`) run under `cargo test`, including feature-gated fast-loop parity checks to guard optimization rollouts.
- **Documentation:** Task checklist updated to reflect expanded coverage; benchmark document references the regression harness for future tuning verification.

### Task 7.0 — Documentation, Release Notes, and Rollout

- **Implementation:** Authored `docs/tuning/material-value-sets.md` as the canonical overview, refreshed the configuration guide with migration/troubleshooting notes, and published release notes capturing rollout guidance.
- **Documentation:** Performance analysis doc now includes telemetry interpretation and regression suite references; workflow doc cross-links to the new summary.
- **Release Prep:** `release-notes-task-11.0-material-evaluation.md` aggregates benchmarking, verification, and rollout steps for downstream teams.

### Task 8.0 — Post-Deployment Monitoring & Follow-up

- **Implementation:** Authored `docs/monitoring/material-evaluation-monitoring.md` covering dashboards, alert rules, regression watch cadence, and backlog follow-up actions.
- **Testing:** Not applicable (documentation/operational plan).
- **Rollout:** Release notes reference the monitoring plan; on-call and tuning teams own telemetry review cycles post deployment.
