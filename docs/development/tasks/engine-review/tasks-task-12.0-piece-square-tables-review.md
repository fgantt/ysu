# Tasks: Piece-Square Tables Modernization

**Parent PRD:** `task-12.0-piece-square-tables-review.md`  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Overview

This task list translates the recommendations from Task 12.0 into actionable engineering work. The goals are to eliminate configuration drift, harden test coverage, introduce configurable/tunable tables, and expand telemetry so PST impact is observable across evaluation and search pipelines.

## Relevant Files

- `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/src/evaluation/piece_square_tables.rs` - Primary PST implementation
- `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/src/evaluation/integration.rs` - Integrated evaluator using PST lookups
- `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/src/evaluation.rs` - Legacy evaluator containing duplicate PST definitions
- `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/src/evaluation/performance.rs` - Performance profiler hooks
- `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/benches/evaluation_performance_optimization_benchmarks.rs` - Existing PST micro-benchmarks
- `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/docs/design/implementation/evaluation-optimizations/tapered-evaluation/` - Supporting documentation for tapered evaluation
- `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/config/` (new) - Proposed location for tunable PST artifacts

### Notes

- Unit tests should live alongside the modules they cover (e.g., `src/evaluation/piece_square_tables.rs`)
- Integration tests belong under `tests/`
- Benchmarks go in `benches/`
- Loader configuration assets should be version-controlled under `config/` with documentation in `docs/`

## Success Criteria

- Unified PST implementation yields identical scores across all evaluation paths within ±1 cp tolerance
- PST tests execute in default CI with promoted-piece coverage and phase consistency assertions
- Loader supports drop-in replacement of PST values without code changes, with validated schema and documentation
- Telemetry surfaces PST contributions in evaluation logs, profiler snapshots, and regression dashboards
- Tuning methodology produces reproducible PST variants with documented validation results
- Performance benchmarks demonstrate <= 1% overhead increase after loader integration, with memory usage documented

Meeting these criteria confirms Task 12.0’s recommendations are fully implemented and production-ready.

## Task 1.0 Completion Notes

- **Implementation:** Removed the legacy `PieceSquareTables` struct from `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/src/evaluation.rs` and routed all lookups through `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/src/evaluation/piece_square_tables.rs`, ensuring promoted pieces and tapered data stay consistent across evaluators. Updated the fallback evaluator to reference the shared module and refreshed inline PST metadata used by feature extraction.
- **Regression Testing:** Added a gated regression test (`test_legacy_and_integrated_evaluators_align_on_sample_positions`) under the `legacy-tests` suite to compare legacy and integrated evaluators across representative SFEN positions, along with adjustments to existing PST assertions to reflect the canonical table values.
- **Validation:** Ran `cargo check` to confirm the codebase builds after the refactor. Attempting to run `cargo test --features legacy-tests` exposed pre-existing failures in unrelated move-ordering modules; these were noted but left unchanged as part of this task.
- **Documentation:** Updated the task checklist to reflect completion of subtasks 1.1–1.5 and captured the migration summary here to align with Section 12.1 of the parent PRD.

---

## Task 2.0 Completion Notes

- **Implementation:** Dropped the `legacy-tests` feature gate around PST unit tests so they execute under the default `cargo test` path. Augmented coverage with promoted-piece symmetry checks and taper interpolation guards inside `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui/src/evaluation/piece_square_tables.rs`.
- **Integration Testing:** Added `tests/evaluation_pipeline_tests.rs` to confirm PST-only configurations weight endgame values more heavily as the phase collapses, providing end-to-end validation across the integrated evaluator pipeline.
- **Validation:** Successfully ran `cargo test piece_square_tables` and `cargo test pst_contribution_increases_as_position_reaches_endgame` to verify the ungated unit suite and new integration scenario.
- **CI Guidance:** Documented the new default coverage expectations here (Section 2.0) so CI owners can rely on `cargo test` without feature flags; runtime impact remains minimal (~4s locally).

---

## Task 3.0 Progress Notes

- **Schema & Loader:** Added `src/evaluation/pst_loader.rs` with JSON schema backing, preset handling, and validation for missing pieces, duplicate entries, and king-table invariants. The loader now deserializes external values into `PieceSquareTables` while defaulting to built-in tables when no override is supplied.
- **Assets:** Generated `config/pst/default.json` from the existing in-tree tables so the default preset reproduces current evaluation behaviour and provides a starting point for tuning.
- **Testing:** Introduced unit tests exercising happy-path loading, missing-entry validation, and king-table zero enforcement; verified with `cargo test pst_loader`.
- **Runtime Wiring:** Added USI options (`PSTPreset`, `PSTPath`) and engine plumbing so presets or custom files can be selected at runtime, with validation flowing through `SearchEngine::set_pst_config`.
- **Documentation:** Authored `docs/design/implementation/evaluation-optimizations/PST_LOADER_USAGE.md`, covering preset selection, JSON schema expectations, and safety checks for custom files.

---

## Task 4.0 Completion Notes

- **Telemetry Surfaces:** Extended `EvaluationTelemetry` and `EvaluationStatistics` with `PieceSquareTelemetry` plus an aggregate PST tracker. Reports and JSON exports now include total middlegame/endgame deltas along with rolling per-piece averages.
- **Runtime Visibility:** Debug logs now emit PST totals, top contributors, rolling averages, and deltas between successive evaluations; the performance profiler continues to surface average PST impact in `PerformanceReport`.
- **Regression Coverage:** Added an integration test (`pst_telemetry_reports_breakdown`) that asserts PST telemetry accompanies evaluations and that aggregates capture per-piece contributions.
- **Documentation:** Updated `docs/development/tasks/engine-review/DEBUG_LOGGING_OPTIMIZATION.md` with instructions for interpreting PST telemetry in logs and leveraging statistics exports during regression/self-play analysis.

---

## Task 5.0 Completion Notes

- **Methodology Guide:** Created `docs/tuning/pst-tuning-methodology.md` to outline data sources, tuning workflow, baseline experiments, and validation gates for PST adjustments.
- **Pipeline Tooling:** Added `pst-tuning-runner` (`cargo run --bin pst-tuning-runner`) to transform 9×9 CSV grids into loader-compatible JSON, enforcing schema checks by construction.
- **Sample Artifact:** Captured `config/pst/experiments/2025-11-10-endgame-bias.json` together with documented telemetry deltas to illustrate an endgame-oriented experiment.
- **Coordination Notes:** Embedded material-alignment guardrails and telemetry review steps in the methodology so positional and material evaluators remain calibrated.

---

## Task 6.0 Completion Notes

- **Shared Storage:** Migrated `PieceSquareTables` to back onto a shared `Arc` guarded by `OnceLock`, eliminating redundant table clones for builtin presets while keeping custom tables isolated.
- **Thread Safety:** The new storage is immutable and reference counted, so evaluators across threads reuse the same underlying arrays without locking overhead.
- **Regression Coverage:** Existing PST loader and telemetry tests continue to pass; default benchmarks show evaluator construction now runs ~96% faster with a ~32 KB per-instance memory reduction (local measurement).
- **Documentation:** Section 12.5 notes updated to reflect shared storage characteristics and benchmarking results.

---

## Task 7.0 Completion Notes

- **Measurement Checklist:** Authored `docs/development/tasks/engine-review/PST_validation_rollout_plan.md` capturing unit/integration/benchmarking/telemetry gates plus staged rollout guidance.
- **Regression Harness:** Added `tests/pst_regression_suite.rs`, ensuring loader defaults match built-in PST contributions across representative opening, middlegame, and endgame boards.
- **Rollout Coordination:** Document outlines staged deployment via USI presets, telemetry sign-offs, and fallback procedures shared with evaluation/search teams.
