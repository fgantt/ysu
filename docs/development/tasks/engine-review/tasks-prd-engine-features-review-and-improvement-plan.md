## Postponed Tasks

**Task 27.0 Implementation Tasks** (Implementation Postponed; Included in Documentation):
- **Implementation Status:** All implementation tasks identified in `tasks-task-27.0-cross-feature-gap-analysis.md` are postponed for future implementation
- These include major features such as:
  - NNUE Evaluation System (6-12 months effort)
  - Advanced Search Techniques (2-3 months effort)
  - Opening/Endgame Enhancements (2-4 months effort)
  - Learning & Adaptation Systems (4-5 months effort)
  - And other improvements (estimated 14-23 months total)
- **Reason for Postponement:** Large scope requires dedicated focus; continue with remaining PRD review tasks first
- **Documentation Status:** Task 27.0 gap analysis findings will be included in:
  - **Task 30.0 (Prioritization):** Task 27.0 improvements will be prioritized and included in the comprehensive improvement roadmap
  - **Task 31.0 (Final Documentation):** Task 27.0 recommendations will be documented in the improvement recommendations document and included in the improvement roadmap with timelines
- **Current Status:** Gap analysis complete; implementation tasks documented and will be prioritized/documented in remaining PRD tasks, but actual implementation deferred

## Remaining Tasks

The following tasks remain to be completed from the PRD:

- **Task 30.0:** Prioritization and Roadmapping (5 sub-tasks)
- **Task 31.0:** Compile Final Documentation (10 sub-tasks)

**Total Remaining:** 15 sub-tasks across 2 meta-tasks

These tasks will synthesize all the review work completed in Tasks 1.0-27.0 into comprehensive documentation deliverables.

---

**Status:** In Progress - Feature review tasks complete (1.0-27.0); Technical debt documentation complete (28.0); Code quality assessment complete (29.0); Continuing with remaining PRD tasks (30.0-31.0); Task 27.0 implementation tasks postponed
