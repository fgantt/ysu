## Feature: Null Move Pruning

**Category:** Search Algorithm  
**Status:** Complete  
**Priority:** High

---

### Current Implementation

- **Location:** `src/search/search_engine.rs`
- **Lines of code:** ~90 lines (null move specific code)
- **Key Methods:**
  - `should_attempt_null_move()` - Condition checking (lines 4464-4491)
  - `perform_null_move_search()` - Null move search execution (lines 4507-4531)
  - `count_pieces_on_board()` - Endgame detection helper (lines 4494-4504)
  - Integration in `negamax_with_context()` (lines 2939-2962)
- **Configuration:** `src/types.rs` - `NullMoveConfig` and `NullMoveStats` (lines 1273-1365)
- **Tests:** `tests/null_move_tests.rs` - 13 test cases

---

## Functionality

Null Move Pruning (NMP) is implemented to identify positions where the current player has such a strong advantage that even giving the opponent a free move (null move) still results in a beta cutoff. This allows aggressive pruning of branches that are unlikely to improve the search result.

---

## Task 2.1: Review null-move pruning implementation in search_engine.rs

### Findings

**✅ Strengths:**
- Proper integration into `negamax_with_context()` before move generation (lines 2939-2962)
- Correct placement after transposition table lookup but before move ordering
- Uses local hash history to prevent interference with main search (lines 2944-2945)
- Prevents recursive null moves by passing `can_null_move: false` in recursive calls (line 4527)
- Proper zero-width window search: `beta.saturating_neg(), beta.saturating_neg().saturating_add(1)` (lines 4525-4526)
- Correct score negation for opponent evaluation: `-self.negamax_with_context(...)` (line 4523)
- Beta cutoff correctly returns `beta` instead of `null_move_score` (line 2957)
- Comprehensive statistics tracking for monitoring and tuning

**⚠️ Concerns:**
- At line 2946, null move search modifies the board state (via `perform_null_move_search`) but the board is passed as mutable reference. The null move search should not modify the original board, but the current implementation calls `negamax_with_context` which may modify board state. However, since null move search doesn't actually make a move on the board (it just passes the turn), this may be acceptable.
- The local hash history created for null move search (lines 2944-2945) is separate from the main search history, which is correct to prevent contamination, but this means null move search doesn't benefit from repetition detection in the main search path.
- No verification search is implemented - if null move fails to cause cutoff, the search continues normally without re-checking at full depth.

**Code Quality:**
- Well-structured with clear separation between condition checking and execution
- Good debug logging support (conditional on feature flags)
- Clean integration with existing search infrastructure
- Statistics tracking provides observability

## Task 2.2: Verify R=2 reduction implementation

### Findings

**✅ Correct Implementation:**
- Default reduction factor is `R=2` as expected (`NullMoveConfig::default()`, line 1287 in `types.rs`)
- Reduction calculation correctly implemented in `perform_null_move_search()` (lines 4513-4517):
  ```rust
  let reduction = if self.null_move_config.enable_dynamic_reduction {
      2 + depth / 6  // Dynamic reduction
  } else {
      self.null_move_config.reduction_factor as u8  // Static reduction
  };
  ```
- Search depth correctly calculated: `search_depth = depth - 1 - reduction` (line 4519)
- Depth reduction statistics tracked: `self.null_move_stats.depth_reductions += reduction as u64` (line 4520)

**✅ Dynamic Reduction Option:**
- Dynamic reduction formula `R = 2 + depth / 6` is implemented (line 4514)
- Default configuration enables dynamic reduction: `enable_dynamic_reduction: true` (line 1289)
- Allows flexible tuning between static and dynamic approaches

**⚠️ Potential Issues:**
- At depth 3 with dynamic reduction: `R = 2 + 3/6 = 2`, which is correct
- At depth 4: `R = 2 + 4/6 = 2` (integer division truncates to 2)
- At depth 6: `R = 2 + 6/6 = 3`, which increases reduction appropriately
- The formula `2 + depth / 6` means reduction only increases at depths 6, 12, 18, etc. This may be too conservative at intermediate depths.
- When static reduction is used, default `reduction_factor = 2` is correct, but the value could be tuned per depth.

**Verification:**
- Default configuration uses `R=2` base reduction factor
- Dynamic reduction provides incremental increases based on depth
- Statistics tracking confirms reduction is applied correctly

## Task 2.3: Check mate threat detection logic

### Findings

**✅ Strengths:**
- Mate threat detection via check detection: `board.is_king_in_check(player, captured_pieces)` (line 4476)
- Properly disabled when in check: returns `false` immediately (lines 4476-4479)
- Statistics tracked: `self.null_move_stats.disabled_in_check += 1` (line 4477)
- Prevents zugzwang-like situations where null move would be invalid

**❌ Missing Features:**
- **No explicit mate threat detection beyond check detection**
- Standard engines often implement "mate threat pruning" (also called "extended null move pruning" or "null move with mate threat verification") where:
  - If null move search fails (score < beta) but returns a very high score (> beta - some margin)
  - A verification search is performed to check if there's a mate threat
  - This can catch positions where null move would prune a mate-in-N line
- Current implementation only checks if the current player is in check, but doesn't verify if the null move search might have missed a mate threat on the opponent

**⚠️ Concerns:**
- The check detection correctly prevents null move when in check (zugzwang situation)
- However, there's no verification search when null move fails but scores highly (potential mate threat)
- Missing mate threat detection could allow null move to prune positions where opponent has a strong mate threat

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing mate threat verification search:
  - If null move search fails (`null_move_score < beta`) but `null_move_score > beta - MATE_THREAT_MARGIN`
  - Perform a verification search at full depth to check for mate threats
  - Only prune if verification search also fails

---

## Task 2.4: Assess endgame termination conditions

### Findings

**✅ Strengths:**
- Endgame detection implemented via piece count threshold (lines 4482-4488)
- Configurable threshold: `max_pieces_threshold` (default: 12 pieces, line 1288)
- Can be disabled: `enable_endgame_detection` flag (default: true, line 1290)
- Statistics tracked: `self.null_move_stats.disabled_endgame += 1` (line 4485)

**✅ Piece Counting:**
- Piece counting method `count_pieces_on_board()` correctly implemented (lines 4494-4504)
- Iterates through all 9x9 squares to count occupied positions
- Used only when `enable_endgame_detection` is true

**⚠️ Concerns:**
- Piece counting method is inefficient: iterates through 81 squares on every null move attempt when endgame detection is enabled
- Could be optimized by tracking piece count in board state or using cached evaluation
- The threshold of 12 pieces is reasonable but may be too conservative or too aggressive depending on position type
- No distinction between different types of endgames:
  - Material endgames (few pieces)
  - King activity endgames (king + few pieces)
  - Zugzwang-prone endgames (specific material combinations)
- The piece count alone doesn't capture zugzwang-prone positions accurately

**Code Quality:**
- Endgame detection logic is clear and well-structured
- Configurable threshold allows tuning
- Statistics provide feedback on how often endgame detection triggers

---

## Task 2.5: Review verification search implementation

### Findings

**❌ Missing Feature:**
- **No verification search is currently implemented**
- Standard null move pruning implementations often include a verification search:
  - If null move search fails (doesn't cause beta cutoff)
  - But the score is close to beta (within some margin, e.g., `beta - 200 centipawns`)
  - Perform a full-depth search to verify the position is truly not good enough to prune
  - This catches cases where null move search with reduced depth might miss tactical sequences

**⚠️ Impact:**
- Current implementation either prunes (if `null_move_score >= beta`) or continues normal search
- Without verification search, some positions that should be pruned might be searched unnecessarily
- More importantly, some positions that shouldn't be pruned (tactical sequences) might be incorrectly pruned if null move search with reduced depth doesn't see them

**✅ What Exists:**
- The null move search itself uses reduced depth correctly
- If null move fails, normal search continues (line 2959 logs continuation)
- No verification overhead when null move succeeds

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing verification search for edge cases:
  - If `null_move_score < beta` but `null_move_score >= beta - VERIFICATION_MARGIN`
  - Perform verification search at full depth `depth - 1` (not `depth - 1 - reduction`)
  - Only prune if verification also fails
  - This adds safety margin for tactical positions while still providing pruning benefits

## Task 2.6: Measure pruning efficiency and effectiveness

### Findings

**✅ Statistics Tracking:**
- Comprehensive statistics in `NullMoveStats`:
  - `attempts`: Number of null move attempts
  - `cutoffs`: Number of successful cutoffs
  - `depth_reductions`: Total depth reductions applied
  - `disabled_in_check`: Times disabled due to check
  - `disabled_endgame`: Times disabled due to endgame
- Helper methods provide metrics:
  - `cutoff_rate()`: Percentage of attempts that result in cutoffs
  - `average_reduction_factor()`: Average reduction applied
  - `efficiency()`: Overall efficiency metric

**✅ Benchmarks:**
- Performance benchmarks exist in `tests/performance_benchmarks.rs`:
  - `benchmark_null_move_performance()` (lines 456-513)
  - `benchmark_null_move_comprehensive_suite()` (lines 616-662)
- Tests compare NMP enabled vs disabled
- Tests verify correctness (scores remain similar)

**⚠️ Measurement Limitations:**
- Benchmarks exist but may not be run regularly
- No automated performance regression testing
- Statistics are tracked but not actively monitored in production
- No integration with continuous performance monitoring

**📊 Expected Performance:**
Based on design document and standard chess/shogi engine literature:
- **20-40% reduction** in nodes searched (expected)
- **15-25% increase** in search depth for same time (expected)
- **10-20% improvement** in playing strength (expected)
- Current implementation should achieve similar results, but actual measurements needed

**Recommendations:**
- Add automated benchmarks that run on CI/CD
- Track statistics over time to detect regressions
- Measure actual performance improvements in game play
- Compare NMP effectiveness across different position types

## Task 2.9: Cross-reference with quiescence search dependencies

### Findings

**✅ Correct Integration:**
- Null move pruning is **not** used in quiescence search, which is correct
- Quiescence search starts at `depth == 0` in `negamax_with_context()` (line 2964)
- Null move pruning occurs **before** the depth check (lines 2939-2962)
- Therefore, null move pruning only applies at depth >= 1, never in quiescence

**✅ Design Rationale:**
- Quiescence search already operates on limited move set (captures, checks, promotions)
- Null move pruning would be less effective in quiescence (already highly pruned)
- Quiescence search has its own pruning techniques (delta pruning, futility pruning)
- Adding null move to quiescence would add overhead without significant benefit

**✅ No Conflicts:**
- Null move search calls `negamax_with_context()` with reduced depth
- When depth reaches 0 in null move search, it correctly calls `quiescence_search()` (line 2967)
- Quiescence search is called recursively within null move search, which is correct
- No circular dependencies or conflicts

**✅ Statistics Separation:**
- Null move statistics (`NullMoveStats`) are separate from quiescence statistics (`QuiescenceStats`)
- No overlap or interference between tracking systems

**⚠️ Potential Optimization:**
- Null move search uses reduced depth, so it often reaches quiescence quickly
- Quiescence search overhead in null move branches is acceptable (necessary for correctness)
- No changes needed - current design is optimal

---

The code quality is good with comprehensive statistics tracking and configurability.

### Key Strengths

1. Correct core NMP algorithm implementation
2. Comprehensive safety mechanisms
3. Good configurability
4. Clean integration with search infrastructure
5. Observable via statistics

### Key Weaknesses

### Performance Expectations

Based on standard implementations, the current NMP should provide:
- 20-40% reduction in nodes searched
- 15-25% increase in search depth for same time
- 10-20% improvement in playing strength

Actual measurements should be performed to verify these expectations.
