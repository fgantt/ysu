**Parent PRD:** `prd-engine-features-review-and-improvement-plan.md`  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Executive Summary

This gap analysis compares the Shogi Engine against state-of-the-art shogi engines (primarily YaneuraOu, elmo, and other top-tier engines) to identify missing features, assess feature completeness, and document competitive gaps. The engine demonstrates **strong foundational capabilities** with comprehensive search algorithms, sophisticated evaluation systems, and modern optimizations, but reveals several strategic gaps in advanced techniques and specialized shogi knowledge.

Key findings:

- ✅ **Core search infrastructure is competitive**: PVS, iterative deepening, null-move pruning, LMR, IID, and quiescence search are all implemented and well-integrated.
- ✅ **Evaluation system is feature-rich**: Tapered evaluation, material/PST, positional/tactical patterns, castle recognition, and endgame patterns provide comprehensive coverage.
- ✅ **Modern optimizations present**: Bitboards, magic bitboards, transposition tables, parallel search (YBWC), and automated tuning systems are implemented.
- ⚠️ **Missing advanced search techniques**: Multi-PV search, singular extensions, SEE (Static Exchange Evaluation), and advanced time management strategies are absent.
- ⚠️ **Limited shogi-specific knowledge**: Opening book coverage is basic, specialized joseki knowledge is minimal, and shogi-specific endgame techniques (like tsumeshogi solving) are not implemented.
- ⚠️ **No neural network integration**: Modern top engines use NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Networks) for evaluation, which this engine lacks entirely.
- ⚠️ **Limited learning capabilities**: No self-play learning, no game database analysis for pattern extraction, and no adaptive opening book updates.

Overall grade: **B (82/100)** — solid foundation with clear paths to competitive parity through targeted feature additions.

### 1.3 Detailed Feature Analysis

#### Search Algorithms

**Strengths:**
- All core search algorithms (PVS, null-move, LMR, IID, quiescence) are implemented and well-integrated.
- Parallel search using YBWC (Young Brothers Wait Concept) provides good scalability.
- Transposition table integration is solid with depth-preferred replacement.

**Gaps:**
- **Multi-PV Search**: Missing ability to search multiple principal variations simultaneously, which is valuable for analysis and understanding position complexity.
- **Singular Extensions**: Not implemented; this technique extends search when a single move stands out significantly, improving tactical accuracy.
- **Probcut**: Missing probabilistic cutoffs based on shallow searches, which can improve search efficiency.
- **Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE)**: Not implemented; critical for accurate capture ordering and pruning decisions in shogi's complex piece interactions.

#### Evaluation System

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive evaluation with tapered system, material, PST, and extensive pattern recognition.
- Castle recognition (Anaguma, Mino, Yagura) demonstrates shogi-specific knowledge.
- Endgame pattern recognition shows understanding of shogi endgame principles.

**Gaps:**
- **NNUE Evaluation**: This is the **most critical gap**. Modern top engines use NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Networks) for evaluation, which provides significantly stronger positional understanding than hand-crafted evaluation functions. This is likely the single largest factor limiting competitive strength.
- **Shogi-Specific Evaluation Features**: While basic patterns are recognized, deeper shogi-specific evaluation (like piece coordination in specific formations, drop value calculations, promotion timing) could be enhanced.

#### Opening Knowledge

**Strengths:**
- Basic opening book is implemented and functional.
- Opening principles evaluation provides some positional guidance.

**Gaps:**
- **Joseki Database**: Missing comprehensive joseki (established opening sequences) knowledge, which is critical for strong shogi play.
- **Opening Theory Integration**: Limited integration of professional opening theory and recent developments.
- **Adaptive Opening Book**: No mechanism to learn from games or update opening book based on results.

#### Endgame

**Strengths:**
- Micro-tablebase implementation for basic endgames (K+G vs K, K+S vs K, K+R vs K).
- Endgame pattern recognition covers zugzwang, opposition, triangulation.

**Gaps:**
- **Tsumeshogi Solver**: Missing dedicated tsumeshogi (checkmate problem) solving capability, which is important for endgame accuracy.
- **Extended Tablebase Coverage**: Current tablebase is limited; top engines support larger tablebases with more pieces.
- **Endgame Knowledge Base**: Could benefit from more comprehensive endgame knowledge beyond pattern recognition.

#### Learning & Adaptation

**Strengths:**
- Automated parameter tuning system (Adam, LBFGS, Genetic Algorithm) is implemented.
- Performance profiling and statistics collection are available.

**Gaps:**
- **Self-Play Learning**: No self-play capability to improve through games against itself.
- **Game Database Analysis**: Missing tools to extract patterns and knowledge from large game databases.
- **Adaptive Opening Book**: Opening book is static; no learning from game results.

## 6. Conclusion

The Shogi Engine demonstrates a **strong technical foundation** with comprehensive search algorithms, sophisticated evaluation systems, and modern optimizations. The codebase is well-structured, well-documented, and provides a solid platform for competitive development.

The **primary competitive gap** is the absence of NNUE evaluation, which is the standard in modern top engines and provides the largest single strength advantage. Additionally, several advanced search techniques (multi-PV, singular extensions, SEE) would provide meaningful improvements.

The engine's **unique strengths** include comprehensive pattern recognition, modular architecture, and automated tuning capabilities. These provide a good foundation for future development.

**Path Forward**: Focus on NNUE implementation as the highest priority, followed by advanced search techniques and enhanced opening/endgame knowledge. With focused development over 14-23 months, the engine could achieve competitive parity with top engines.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Research NNUE implementation approaches and requirements
