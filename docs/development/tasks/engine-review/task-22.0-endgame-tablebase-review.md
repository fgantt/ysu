# Task 22.0: Endgame Tablebase Review

**Parent PRD:** `prd-engine-features-review-and-improvement-plan.md`  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Executive Summary

The endgame tablebase system is **well-architected and modular**, featuring a pluggable solver framework, intelligent caching, performance profiling, and comprehensive configuration management. The implementation provides three specialized solvers (King+Gold, King+Silver, King+Rook vs King) with a clean trait-based architecture that enables easy extension. The system integrates seamlessly with the search engine, providing perfect play information for covered endgame positions.

Key findings:

- ✅ Modular solver architecture with `EndgameSolver` trait enables clean extension and testing.
- ✅ Position caching system with multiple eviction strategies (LRU, LFU, FIFO) and adaptive eviction reduces redundant calculations.
- ✅ Performance profiling infrastructure tracks probe times, hit rates, and solver effectiveness.
- ✅ Search engine integration probes tablebase before search, prioritizing tablebase moves in move ordering.
- ⚠️ Solver implementations contain incomplete logic: checkmate detection is stubbed, distance-to-mate calculations are simplified estimates, and move generation lacks full legality validation.
- ⚠️ King+Gold solver has the most complete implementation; King+Silver and King+Rook solvers have significant TODOs and placeholder logic.
- ⚠️ Position cache key generation may not account for all position state (e.g., move history for repetition detection).
- ⚠️ No verification that solvers produce correct/optimal moves; testing coverage is minimal.

Overall grade: **B (82/100)** — solid architectural foundation with clear implementation gaps that need completion for production use.

## 1. Implementation Review (Task 22.1)

### 1.1 Core Architecture
- `MicroTablebase` owns:
  - `solvers: Vec<Box<dyn EndgameSolver>>` – Priority-sorted list of endgame solvers.
  - `position_cache: PositionCache` – LRU/LFU/FIFO cache for position results.
  - `config: TablebaseConfig` – Comprehensive configuration (cache size, eviction strategy, memory limits).
  - `stats: TablebaseStats` – Performance metrics (probe counts, hit rates, solver breakdown).
  - `position_analyzer: PositionAnalyzer` – Adaptive solver selection based on position complexity.
  - `profiler: TablebaseProfiler` – Detailed timing instrumentation.
- Construction provides `new()` and `with_config()`, ensuring consistent initialization.
- Solver priority sorting ensures most specific solvers are tried first.

### 1.2 Solver Framework
- `EndgameSolver` trait defines clean interface:
  - `can_solve()` – Quick pattern recognition.
  - `solve()` – Optimal move calculation.
  - `priority()` – Solver precedence (higher = more important).
  - `name()`, `is_enabled()`, `max_depth()` – Metadata and configuration.
- `EndgameSolverHelper` trait provides blanket implementation of common utilities (piece counting, distance calculations).
- `AdvancedEndgameSolver` trait extends base interface for alternative moves and detailed analysis (not used by current solvers).

### 1.3 Position Caching
- `PositionCache` uses `HashMap<u64, CacheEntry>` for O(1) lookups.
- Cache entry includes result, last access time, access count, creation time.
- Eviction strategies:
  - `LRU` – Least recently used (default).
  - `LFU` – Least frequently used.
  - `FIFO` – First in, first out.
  - Adaptive eviction switches strategies based on access patterns.
- Memory monitoring with configurable limits and automatic eviction when thresholds exceeded.
- Cache key generation uses position hash; may not include all state (e.g., move history for repetition).

### 1.4 Statistics and Configuration
- `TablebaseStats` tracks:
  - Probe counts (total, hits, misses, solver hits).
  - Hit rates (cache, solver, overall).
  - Probe timing (average, total).
  - Memory usage and warnings.
  - Solver breakdown percentages.
- `TablebaseConfig` provides:
  - `default()` – Standard configuration.
  - `performance_optimized()` – Larger cache, aggressive eviction.
  - `memory_optimized()` – Smaller cache, conservative eviction.
- Per-solver configuration (`KingGoldConfig`, `KingSilverConfig`, `KingRookConfig`) allows fine-grained control.

## 2. Solver Implementation Verification (Tasks 22.2 – 22.4)

### 2.1 King+Gold vs King Solver (Task 22.2)
- **Pattern Recognition**: `is_king_gold_vs_king()` correctly identifies positions with exactly King+Gold vs King, no captured pieces.
- **Move Generation**: 
  - `generate_king_moves()` and `generate_gold_moves()` implement piece-specific movement patterns.
  - Gold moves: forward, backward, left, right, diagonally forward (6 directions).
  - King moves: all 8 adjacent squares.
  - ⚠️ Move legality checks are simplified; doesn't verify check legality or full shogi rules.
- **Mating Logic**:
  - `find_immediate_mate()` checks for mate in one.
  - `approach_with_king()` uses Manhattan distance to approach defending king.
  - `coordinate_king_gold_mate()` attempts to coordinate pieces for mating.
  - ⚠️ `is_mating_move()` only checks if move attacks king's square; doesn't verify actual checkmate.
- **Distance Calculation**: `calculate_distance_to_mate()` uses simplified Manhattan distance heuristic; not actual DTM (Distance To Mate).
- ✅ Most complete solver implementation; still has gaps in checkmate verification.

### 2.2 King+Silver vs King Solver (Task 22.3)
- **Pattern Recognition**: `is_king_silver_vs_king()` correctly identifies King+Silver vs King positions.
- **Move Generation**:
  - Silver moves account for player-specific directions (Black vs White).
  - Silver can move diagonally forward/backward and straight forward.
  - ⚠️ `is_legal_move()` has TODO comment; only checks bounds and same-color capture.
- **Mating Logic**:
  - `is_mating_move()` returns `false` (TODO stub).
  - `is_checkmate()` returns `false` (TODO stub).
  - `is_stalemate()` returns `false` (TODO stub).
- **Evaluation**: `evaluate_move()` uses distance-based heuristics; coordination and mobility restriction logic are TODO stubs.
- ⚠️ Significant incomplete implementation; solver will not produce correct results.

### 2.3 King+Rook vs King Solver (Task 22.4)
- **Pattern Recognition**: `is_king_rook_vs_king()` correctly identifies King+Rook vs King positions.
- **Move Generation**:
  - Rook moves horizontally and vertically with proper range checking.
  - Stops at first piece encountered (capture or block).
  - ⚠️ `is_legal_move()` has TODO comment; legality checks incomplete.
- **Mating Logic**:
  - `is_mating_move()` returns `false` (TODO stub).
  - `is_checkmate()` returns `false` (TODO stub).
  - `is_stalemate()` returns `false` (TODO stub).
- **Evaluation**: `evaluate_move()` includes rook-specific key square control, but `controls_key_squares()` is TODO stub.
- ⚠️ Significant incomplete implementation; solver will not produce correct results.

## 3. Lookup Performance (Task 22.5)

### 3.1 Cache Performance
- Cache lookup is O(1) via `HashMap`; key generation uses position hash.
- Cache hit rate tracked in `TablebaseStats`; `hit_rate()` provides 0.0-1.0 metric.
- Eviction overhead:
  - LRU: O(n) scan for least recently used entry.
  - LFU: O(n) scan for least frequently used entry.
  - FIFO: O(1) with queue-based tracking (not fully implemented).
- Memory monitoring checks at configurable intervals to avoid overhead.

### 3.2 Solver Performance
- Solver selection uses priority ordering; first matching solver is used.
- `PositionAnalyzer` filters solvers by complexity to skip unsuitable solvers.
- Solver `can_solve()` should be fast (pattern recognition only); actual solving may be slower.
- ⚠️ No performance benchmarks or profiling data available for solver execution times.

### 3.3 Integration Performance
- Search engine probes tablebase before search (lines 4285-4326 in `search_engine.rs`).
- Tablebase probe timing tracked via `debug_utils`; results logged.
- Move ordering integration checks tablebase for each move candidate (lines 6617-6640); may be expensive if done naively.
- ⚠️ `is_tablebase_move()` makes/unmakes moves for each candidate; could be optimized with better caching.

## 4. Coverage and Effectiveness (Task 22.6)

### 4.1 Solver Coverage
- **King+Gold vs King**: ✅ Implemented (most complete).
- **King+Silver vs King**: ⚠️ Implemented but incomplete (TODOs).
- **King+Rook vs King**: ⚠️ Implemented but incomplete (TODOs).
- **Other endgames**: ❌ Not implemented (e.g., King+Bishop, King+Lance, King+Knight, multi-piece endgames).

### 4.2 Position Coverage
- Solvers only handle positions with exactly 3 pieces (2 vs 1).
- No support for:
  - Positions with captured pieces (all solvers require empty hands).
  - Multi-piece endgames (4+ pieces).
  - Promoted piece endgames.
  - Drop moves in endgames.
- ⚠️ Coverage is very limited compared to full tablebase systems.

### 4.3 Correctness
- ⚠️ No verification that solvers produce correct/optimal moves.
- Checkmate detection is stubbed in Silver and Rook solvers.
- Distance-to-mate calculations are heuristics, not actual DTM.
- ⚠️ No test suite with known endgame positions and expected results.

### 4.4 Integration Effectiveness
- Search engine integration is correct: probes before search, uses results when available.
- Move ordering prioritizes tablebase moves correctly.
- ⚠️ Effectiveness depends on solver correctness, which is unverified.

## 6. Improvement Recommendations (Task 22.8)

| Priority | Recommendation | Rationale | Effort |
|---------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **High** | Complete checkmate detection in King+Silver and King+Rook solvers; implement proper `is_mating_move()`, `is_checkmate()`, `is_stalemate()`. | Solver correctness is critical; current stubs prevent accurate results. | 8–12 hrs |
| **High** | Implement proper DTM (Distance To Mate) calculation instead of Manhattan distance heuristics. Use retrograde analysis or known endgame theory. | Accurate distance-to-mate is essential for optimal play and search integration. | 12–20 hrs |
| **High** | Add comprehensive test suite with known endgame positions and expected results. Verify solver correctness against endgame theory. | Without verification, solver correctness is unknown. | 6–10 hrs |
| **Medium** | Complete move legality validation in all solvers; verify check legality, shogi-specific rules (drop restrictions, promotion zones). | Current simplified checks may allow illegal moves. | 8–12 hrs |
| **Medium** | Optimize `is_tablebase_move()` in move ordering: cache probe results or use position hash instead of making/unmaking moves. | Current implementation is expensive for move ordering. | 4–6 hrs |
| **Medium** | Extend cache key generation to include move history or repetition state if needed for correctness. | Current key may miss position equivalence in some cases. | 4–6 hrs |
| **Medium** | Add performance benchmarks for solver execution times; document expected probe latency. | Needed for performance analysis and optimization. | 4–6 hrs |
| **Low** | Implement additional endgame solvers (King+Bishop, King+Lance, King+Knight, multi-piece endgames). | Expands coverage but requires significant effort. | 20–40 hrs |
| **Low** | Support endgames with captured pieces (drops in endgames). | Expands coverage but complicates solver logic. | 12–20 hrs |
| **Low** | Implement `AdvancedEndgameSolver` methods in existing solvers (alternative moves, detailed analysis). | Enhances functionality but not critical for basic operation. | 6–10 hrs |

## 7. Testing & Validation Plan

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Add test cases for each solver with known endgame positions.
   - Verify pattern recognition (`can_solve()`) for correct and incorrect positions.
   - Test move generation for all piece types in each solver.
   - Verify checkmate detection with known mate-in-one positions.
   - Test distance-to-mate calculation against known DTM values.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test tablebase integration with search engine: verify probes occur, results are used.
   - Test move ordering: verify tablebase moves are prioritized.
   - Test caching: verify hit rates, eviction behavior, memory limits.
   - Test configuration: verify presets work, custom configs are applied.

3. **Correctness Tests**
   - Create test suite of known endgame positions with expected optimal moves.
   - Verify solver results match endgame theory (e.g., King+Gold vs King is always winning).
   - Test edge cases: stalemate, draw by repetition, impossible positions.

4. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Measure probe latency (cache hit vs miss vs solver calculation).
   - Measure solver execution times for each solver type.
   - Measure cache hit rates in realistic game scenarios.
   - Profile memory usage and eviction overhead.

5. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Document which endgame types are covered vs not covered.
   - Measure hit rate in actual games (what percentage of endgame positions are solved).
   - Identify most common endgame patterns not covered.

## 8. Conclusion

The endgame tablebase system provides a solid architectural foundation with a clean, extensible design. The modular solver framework, intelligent caching, and comprehensive configuration make it easy to add new solvers and optimize performance. However, the current implementation has significant gaps: solver logic is incomplete (checkmate detection stubbed, distance calculations are heuristics), correctness is unverified, and coverage is limited to basic 3-piece endgames.

Addressing the high-priority recommendations—completing checkmate detection, implementing proper DTM calculation, and adding a test suite—will transform the system from "architecturally sound but incomplete" to "production-ready and verified." The medium-priority optimizations (move legality, performance improvements) will enhance reliability and efficiency. Subsequent efforts can expand coverage to additional endgame types and support more complex scenarios.

**Next Steps:** File engineering tickets for the high-priority recommendations, align them with meta-task 26.0 (performance analysis), and update documentation once fixes land to maintain PRD traceability.
