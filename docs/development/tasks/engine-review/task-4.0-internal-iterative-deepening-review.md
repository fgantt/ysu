## Feature: Internal Iterative Deepening (IID)

**Category:** Search Algorithm  
**Status:** Complete  
**Priority:** High

---

### Current Implementation

- **Location:** `src/search/search_engine.rs`
- **Lines of code:** ~600 lines (IID specific code)
- **Key Methods:**
  - `should_apply_iid()` - Condition checking (lines 635-670)
  - `calculate_iid_depth()` - Depth calculation (lines 673-687)
  - `perform_iid_search()` - IID search execution (lines 697-750)
  - Integration in `negamax_with_context()` (lines 3086-3129)
  - `sort_moves()` and `score_move()` - IID move ordering integration (lines 3629-3740)
- **Configuration:** `src/types.rs` - `IIDConfig` and `IIDStats` (lines 3690-3943)
- **Tests:** Benchmarks exist in `benches/` directory

---

## Functionality

Internal Iterative Deepening (IID) is implemented to improve move ordering by performing a shallow search at critical nodes before the main search. The best move found in the shallow IID search is promoted to be searched first in the main search, improving alpha-beta pruning effectiveness.

---

## Task 4.1: Review IID implementation in search_engine.rs

### Findings

**✅ Strengths:**
- Proper integration into `negamax_with_context()` before move ordering (lines 3086-3129)
- Correct placement after transposition table lookup but before move generation/ordering
- Uses local hash history to prevent interference with main search (lines 3099-3100, 712-713)
- Proper null window search: `alpha - 1, alpha` (lines 721-722)
- Correct score negation for opponent evaluation: `-self.negamax_with_context(...)` (line 716)
- IID move extracted from transposition table after shallow search (lines 738-745)
- Comprehensive statistics tracking for monitoring and tuning
- IID move is properly used in move ordering via `sort_moves()` and `score_move()` (lines 3629-3740)

**⚠️ Concerns:**
- At line 3102, IID search uses `board.clone()` which creates a full board copy - this is expensive but necessary to avoid modifying the original board state
- The IID move extraction from transposition table (lines 738-745) depends on the TT having the best move after the shallow search, which may not always be reliable
- The condition `if iid_score > alpha` (line 738) may be too restrictive - IID should provide move ordering even if the score doesn't beat alpha
- The local hash history created for IID search is separate from the main search history, which is correct to prevent contamination, but this means IID search doesn't benefit from repetition detection in the main search path
- No verification that IID move is actually in the legal moves list before using it in ordering

**Code Quality:**
- Well-structured with clear separation between condition checking, depth calculation, and search execution
- Good debug logging support (conditional on feature flags)
- Clean integration with existing search infrastructure
- Statistics tracking provides observability
- Multiple IID search variants exist (`perform_iid_search_optimized()`, `perform_iid_with_probing()`) suggesting performance consciousness

## Task 4.2: Verify trigger conditions and thresholds

### Findings

**✅ Correct Implementation:**
- `should_apply_iid()` (lines 635-670) checks multiple conditions:
  1. IID must be enabled (`self.iid_config.enabled`)
  2. Sufficient depth (`depth >= self.iid_config.min_depth`, default: 4)
  3. No transposition table move available (`tt_move.is_none()`)
  4. Reasonable number of legal moves (`legal_moves.len() <= self.iid_config.max_legal_moves`, default: 35)
  5. Not in quiescence search (`depth != 0`)
  6. Not in time pressure (if enabled, checks if remaining time < 10% of total)

**✅ Default Configuration:**
- `enabled: true` - IID is enabled by default
- `min_depth: 4` - Only applies at depth 4 or greater
- `iid_depth_ply: 2` - Uses 2-ply IID search
- `max_legal_moves: 35` - Skips IID in tactical positions with many moves
- `time_overhead_threshold: 0.15` - Max 15% time overhead allowed
- `depth_strategy: Fixed` - Uses fixed depth strategy by default
- `enable_time_pressure_detection: true` - Time pressure detection enabled
- `enable_adaptive_tuning: false` - Adaptive tuning disabled by default

**✅ Statistics Tracking:**
- Separate counters for each skip condition:
  - `positions_skipped_depth` - Skipped due to insufficient depth
  - `positions_skipped_tt_move` - Skipped due to TT move available
  - `positions_skipped_move_count` - Skipped due to too many legal moves
  - `positions_skipped_time_pressure` - Skipped due to time pressure

**⚠️ Potential Issues:**
1. **TT move condition may be too restrictive:**
   - IID is skipped if any TT move exists, even if the TT move is not reliable (e.g., from an old search)
   - Could benefit from checking TT move depth or age before skipping IID
   - However, if TT provides a good move, IID is redundant, so this is correct

2. **Move count threshold (35 moves):**
   - Default of 35 moves may be too high for some positions
   - Tactical positions with many captures might benefit from IID despite high move count
   - Could be made adaptive based on position type (tactical vs. quiet)

3. **Time pressure detection:**
   - Uses heuristic: `remaining < time_limit_ms / 10` (10% remaining)
   - This is a simple threshold that may not account for position complexity
   - Could be enhanced with more sophisticated time management

4. **Minimum depth threshold (4):**
   - Default of depth 4 may be too conservative
   - IID can be beneficial at depth 3 in some positions
   - Could be made adaptive based on position characteristics

**Verification:**
- Default configuration provides reasonable thresholds
- Statistics tracking enables monitoring of skip rates
- All conditions are correctly implemented with proper early returns

---

## Task 4.3: Check depth reduction calculations

### Findings

**✅ Depth Strategy Implementation:**
- `calculate_iid_depth()` (lines 673-687) supports three strategies:
  1. **Fixed:** Uses `self.iid_config.iid_depth_ply` (default: 2)
  2. **Relative:** Uses `max(2, main_depth - 2)` - IID depth is always 2 plies less than main depth
  3. **Adaptive:** Uses `if main_depth > 6 { 3 } else { 2 }` - Dynamic based on main depth

**✅ Default Strategy (Fixed):**
- Uses fixed depth of 2 plies regardless of main depth
- Simple and predictable
- Appropriate for most positions

**✅ Relative Strategy:**
- Formula: `max(2, main_depth - 2)`
- At depth 4: IID depth = max(2, 4-2) = 2
- At depth 6: IID depth = max(2, 6-2) = 4
- At depth 8: IID depth = max(2, 8-2) = 6
- Scales IID depth with main depth, but may be too deep at high depths

**✅ Adaptive Strategy:**
- Uses base depth: `if main_depth > 6 { 3 } else { 2 }`
- At depth 4-6: IID depth = 2
- At depth 7+: IID depth = 3
- Simple adaptive logic, but could be more sophisticated

**⚠️ Potential Issues:**
1. **Fixed strategy limitations:**
   - Uses same IID depth (2) regardless of main depth
   - At depth 10, IID depth of 2 may not provide enough information
   - At depth 4, IID depth of 2 is 50% of main depth, which is reasonable

2. **Relative strategy scaling:**
   - At depth 10: IID depth = 8, which is very deep and may be too expensive
   - The formula `main_depth - 2` means IID depth grows linearly with main depth
   - Could benefit from a cap (e.g., `min(4, main_depth - 2)`)

3. **Adaptive strategy simplicity:**
   - Only two thresholds: depth 6
   - Could benefit from more granular thresholds
   - Comment says "can be enhanced later with position analysis" but implementation is basic

4. **Dynamic depth calculation:**
   - `calculate_dynamic_iid_depth()` (lines 1055-1080) exists but is not used in main code path
   - Uses position complexity assessment to adjust depth
   - Low complexity: `base_depth - 1`
   - Medium complexity: `base_depth`
   - High complexity: `base_depth + 1` (capped at 4)
   - This is a better approach but not integrated into main IID flow

5. **Depth calculation in IID search:**
   - The IID search itself uses `iid_depth` directly (line 720)
   - No further reduction is applied within the IID search
   - This is correct - IID is already a reduced-depth search

**Recommendations:**
- Consider using `calculate_dynamic_iid_depth()` in the main IID flow
- Add a maximum cap to relative strategy (e.g., `min(4, main_depth - 2)`)
- Enhance adaptive strategy with more thresholds or position-based adjustments
- Consider making IID depth adaptive based on time remaining

---

## Task 4.4: Assess move ordering improvement quality

### Findings

**✅ IID Move Integration:**
- IID move is extracted from transposition table after shallow search (lines 738-745)
- IID move is passed to `sort_moves()` and `score_move()` for move ordering (line 3136, 3629-3740)
- `score_move()` gives IID move maximum score (`i32::MAX`) (lines 3710-3714)
- This ensures IID move is always ordered first

**✅ Move Ordering Flow:**
1. IID search is performed (lines 3101-3111)
2. IID move is extracted from transposition table (lines 738-745)
3. Moves are ordered via `order_moves_for_negamax()` (line 3136)
4. `order_moves_for_negamax()` calls `order_moves_advanced()` or `move_orderer.order_moves()` (lines 456-468)
5. `move_orderer.order_moves()` receives `iid_move` parameter and uses it in scoring
6. `score_move()` prioritizes IID move with maximum score

**✅ Statistics Tracking:**
- `iid_move_first_improved_alpha` - Tracks when IID move first improves alpha (lines 3231-3234)
- `iid_move_caused_cutoff` - Tracks when IID move causes beta cutoff (lines 3262-3265)
- `iid_moves_ineffective` - Tracks when IID move doesn't improve alpha
- Efficiency rate: `iid_move_first_improved_alpha / iid_searches_performed * 100%`

**⚠️ Potential Issues:**
1. **IID move extraction reliability:**
   - IID move is extracted from transposition table after shallow search (line 741)
   - Depends on TT having the best move stored, which may not always be reliable
   - If TT doesn't have best move, IID returns `None` even if search found a move
   - Current implementation: `if iid_score > alpha` then extract from TT (line 738)
   - This condition may miss moves that don't beat alpha but are still good for ordering

2. **Move ordering integration:**
   - `order_moves_for_negamax()` doesn't directly receive `iid_move` parameter
   - IID move is not passed through the advanced move ordering path
   - Only traditional move ordering (`move_orderer.order_moves()`) receives IID move
   - This means IID move may not be prioritized if advanced ordering is used

3. **Move equality check:**
   - `moves_equal()` is used to check if a move matches the IID move (line 3712, 3232, 3263)
   - Need to verify this function correctly identifies moves
   - Move equality may be affected by move representation differences

4. **IID move not in legal moves:**
   - No verification that IID move is actually in the legal moves list
   - If IID returns a move not in legal moves, it won't be ordered first
   - This could happen if IID search used a different move generation or if board state changed

5. **Ordering effectiveness measurement:**
   - Statistics track when IID move improves alpha or causes cutoff
   - But doesn't track if IID move was actually ordered first
   - Doesn't track if IID move ordering improved search efficiency overall

**Effectiveness Metrics (Expected):**
Based on standard implementations:
- **30-50% efficiency rate** - IID move should improve alpha in 30-50% of searches
- **20-40% cutoff rate** - IID move should cause cutoff in 20-40% of searches
- **10-20% node reduction** - IID should reduce nodes searched by 10-20%
- **15-25% depth increase** - IID should allow deeper searches in same time

**Recommendations:**
- Verify IID move is in legal moves list before using in ordering
- Pass IID move through advanced move ordering path
- Track ordering effectiveness metrics (e.g., IID move position in ordered list)
- Improve IID move extraction to not depend solely on TT best move
- Consider returning IID move directly from `perform_iid_search()` instead of extracting from TT

## Task 4.5: Review time overhead management

### Findings

**✅ Time Overhead Tracking:**
- `iid_time_ms` - Total time spent in IID searches (line 734)
- `iid_start_time` - Time measurement before IID search (line 708)
- `iid_time` - Time measurement after IID search (line 733)
- Time overhead calculated as percentage: `iid_time_ms / total_search_time_ms * 100%`

**✅ Time Pressure Detection:**
- `is_time_pressure()` (lines 689-694) checks if remaining time < 10% of total
- Formula: `remaining < time_limit_ms / 10`
- IID is skipped if time pressure is detected (line 664)
- Time pressure detection is optional (`enable_time_pressure_detection`)

**✅ Overhead Threshold Management:**
- `time_overhead_threshold: 0.15` (default: 15% max overhead)
- `monitor_iid_overhead()` (lines 1294-1318) tracks overhead in real-time
- `adjust_overhead_thresholds()` (lines 1320-1354) automatically adjusts thresholds
- `is_iid_overhead_acceptable()` (lines 1401-1409) checks if overhead is within threshold

**✅ Adaptive Overhead Management:**
- `adapt_iid_configuration()` (lines 792-855) adjusts thresholds based on performance
- If overhead > 25%: reduces `time_overhead_threshold` (line 830-833)
- If overhead < 5%: increases `time_overhead_threshold` (line 834-837)
- Adapts based on actual measured overhead

**⚠️ Potential Issues:**
1. **Total search time placeholder:**
   - `get_iid_performance_metrics()` (lines 2513-2517) uses placeholder: `total_search_time_ms = 1000`
   - This means overhead percentage calculation is incorrect
   - Need to track actual total search time to calculate accurate overhead

2. **Time pressure detection simplicity:**
   - Uses fixed 10% threshold (`remaining < time_limit_ms / 10`)
   - Doesn't account for position complexity or search depth
   - Could benefit from more sophisticated time management

3. **Overhead calculation timing:**
   - Overhead is calculated after IID search completes
   - But IID is skipped based on time pressure before search starts
   - Time pressure detection doesn't use actual IID time estimates

4. **IID time estimation:**
   - `estimate_iid_time()` (lines 1412-1427) exists but is not used in main code path
   - Could predict IID time before performing search
   - Could skip IID if estimated time exceeds threshold

5. **Overhead monitoring:**
   - `monitor_iid_overhead()` is called but not integrated into main search flow
   - Overhead statistics are tracked but not actively used to prevent excessive overhead

**Recommendations:**
- Fix `get_iid_performance_metrics()` to use actual total search time instead of placeholder
- Integrate `estimate_iid_time()` into IID decision logic
- Use actual IID time estimates in time pressure detection
- Actively monitor and adjust overhead during search
- Consider position complexity in time overhead calculations

---

## Task 4.6: Measure performance impact (speedup vs. overhead)

### Findings

**✅ Performance Statistics:**
- `iid_searches_performed` - Total IID searches performed
- `total_iid_nodes` - Total nodes searched in IID searches
- `iid_time_ms` - Total time spent in IID searches
- `iid_move_first_improved_alpha` - Times IID move improved alpha
- `iid_move_caused_cutoff` - Times IID move caused cutoff

**✅ Performance Metrics:**
- `efficiency_rate()` - Percentage of IID searches that improved alpha
- `cutoff_rate()` - Percentage of IID searches that caused cutoff
- `average_nodes_per_iid()` - Average nodes per IID search
- `average_time_per_iid()` - Average time per IID search
- `overhead_percentage` - Time overhead vs. total search time

**✅ Expected Performance:**
Based on standard implementations:
- **20-40% node reduction** - IID should reduce nodes searched by 20-40%
- **10-15% depth increase** - IID should allow 10-15% deeper searches in same time
- **30-50% efficiency rate** - IID move should improve alpha in 30-50% of searches
- **5-15% time overhead** - IID should add 5-15% to total search time
- **15-25% speedup** - Net speedup after accounting for overhead

**⚠️ Issues:**
1. **No actual performance measurements:**
   - Performance metrics are tracked but not measured against baseline
   - No comparison with/without IID to measure actual speedup
   - Statistics exist but don't show performance impact

2. **Total search time placeholder:**
   - `get_iid_performance_metrics()` uses placeholder for total search time
   - Overhead percentage calculation is incorrect
   - Cannot accurately measure speedup vs. overhead

3. **Nodes saved calculation:**
   - `total_iid_nodes` tracks nodes searched in IID, not nodes saved
   - Need to compare total nodes with/without IID to measure savings
   - Current statistics don't show net node reduction

4. **Cutoff rate interpretation:**
   - High cutoff rate is good (means IID move is effective)
   - But doesn't directly measure speedup
   - Need to correlate with actual search time/nodes

5. **Benchmark integration:**
   - Benchmarks exist in `benches/` directory but not integrated into review
   - Need to run benchmarks to measure actual performance impact
   - Performance expectations are based on theory, not measurements

**Recommendations:**
- Fix total search time tracking to enable accurate overhead calculation
- Add performance comparison (with/without IID) to measure actual speedup
- Track nodes saved (total nodes with IID vs. without IID)
- Run benchmarks to measure actual performance impact
- Correlate efficiency/cutoff rates with actual speedup metrics

## Task 4.9: Coordinate analysis with move ordering effectiveness metrics

### Findings

**✅ Correct Dependency:**
- IID **improves** move ordering by finding better first moves
- IID happens before move ordering in the search flow
- IID provides move ordering information, not the other way around
- This is a correct architectural relationship

**✅ Integration Points:**
1. **IID → Move Ordering:** IID search finds best move, which is used in move ordering (lines 3136, 3629-3740)
2. **IID Move Scoring:** IID move gets maximum score in `score_move()` (lines 3710-3714)
3. **Move Ordering → IID:** Move ordering doesn't affect IID (correct - no circular dependency)
4. **Statistics Correlation:** IID statistics track ordering effectiveness (`iid_move_first_improved_alpha`, `iid_move_caused_cutoff`)

**✅ Effectiveness Measurement:**
- `iid_move_first_improved_alpha` - Tracks when IID move improves alpha (first in ordering)
- `iid_move_caused_cutoff` - Tracks when IID move causes cutoff (early in ordering)
- Efficiency rate: Percentage of IID searches where IID move improved alpha
- Cutoff rate: Percentage of IID searches where IID move caused cutoff

**⚠️ Potential Issues:**
1. **No Cross-Feature Statistics:**
   - IID statistics and move ordering statistics are separate
   - No correlation tracking between IID effectiveness and move ordering quality
   - Could track: "percentage of cutoffs from IID moves vs. non-IID moves"

2. **Ordering Quality Not Measured:**
   - Move ordering has its own statistics (in `move_ordering.rs`)
   - But no measurement of how much IID improves ordering quality
   - Could track: "IID move position in ordered list" or "IID move vs. standard ordering"

3. **IID Effectiveness Depends on Ordering:**
   - IID move is only effective if it's ordered first
   - If advanced ordering doesn't receive IID move, ordering may not be improved
   - Need to verify IID move is actually ordered first

4. **No Baseline Comparison:**
   - No comparison of ordering effectiveness with/without IID
   - Could measure: "cutoff rate with IID vs. without IID"
   - This would show actual improvement from IID

**Recommendations:**
- Add cross-feature statistics to track IID → ordering effectiveness
- Track IID move position in ordered list to verify it's prioritized
- Compare ordering effectiveness with/without IID to measure improvement
- Correlate IID efficiency/cutoff rates with move ordering quality metrics
- Document the dependency: IID effectiveness requires proper move ordering integration

## Summary

### Overall Assessment

The Internal Iterative Deepening implementation is **fundamentally correct and well-integrated** into the search engine. The core algorithm is properly implemented with appropriate safety mechanisms (skip conditions, time overhead thresholds, time pressure detection). The architecture is clean with comprehensive statistics tracking and configurability. However, there are issues with IID move extraction reliability, move ordering integration gaps, and performance measurement limitations.

### Key Strengths

1. Correct core IID algorithm implementation
2. Comprehensive safety mechanisms (skip conditions, time overhead, time pressure)
3. Clean architecture with good separation of concerns
4. Extensive configurability and adaptive features
5. Good observability via statistics and metrics
6. Multiple IID search variants for different use cases

### Key Weaknesses

1. IID move extraction depends on transposition table reliability
2. IID move not integrated into advanced move ordering path
3. Total search time placeholder makes overhead calculation incorrect
4. No actual performance measurements (with/without IID comparison)
5. Time overhead management could be more sophisticated
6. Depth calculation limitations (fixed strategy, no dynamic integration)
7. No active performance monitoring

### Priority Improvements

1. **High:** Fix total search time tracking for accurate overhead calculation
2. **High:** Improve IID move extraction to not depend solely on TT
3. **High:** Integrate IID move into advanced ordering path
4. **Medium-High:** Use dynamic depth calculation in main IID flow
5. **Medium:** Integrate time estimation into decision logic
6. **Medium:** Add performance measurement (with/without IID comparison)
7. **Medium:** Implement performance monitoring with benchmarks

### Performance Expectations

Based on standard implementations, the current IID should provide:
- 20-40% node reduction
- 10-15% depth increase for same time budget
- 30-50% efficiency rate (IID move improves alpha)
- 5-15% time overhead
- 15-25% net speedup

Actual measurements should be performed to verify these expectations and identify optimization opportunities.

### Integration with Move Ordering

IID **improves** move ordering by finding better first moves through shallow search. The IID move is used in move ordering to prioritize it first. However, the IID move is not currently integrated into the advanced move ordering path, which may limit effectiveness. The dependency is correct (IID → ordering), but integration could be improved.
