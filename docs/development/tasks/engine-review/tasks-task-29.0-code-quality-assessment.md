# Tasks: Code Quality Assessment

**Parent PRD:** `task-29.0-code-quality-assessment.md`  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Overview

This task list captures the implementation work derived from the Code Quality Assessment. The scope focuses on maintainability, documentation, API clarity across Rust/TypeScript boundaries, and CI visibility for tests/coverage. This document currently lists only the high-level parent tasks. Sub-tasks and relevant files will be generated after confirmation.

---

## Relevant Files

- `src/` - Core engine Rust code; primary targets for maintainability and documentation improvements.
- `src/evaluation/` - Evaluators likely to be split into `extractors/` and `aggregators/`.
- `src/search/` - Public-facing structures and stats separation; rustdoc targets.
- `src/bitboards/`, `src/tablebase/`, `src/opening_book/` - Public API docs and module index references.
- `src/types.rs` - Public types, configuration structs, statistics; `Debug` derives, docs, decoupling config/stats.
- `src/utils/` (Rust) - Target location to consolidate shared helpers/traits.
- `src/components/`, `src/utils/` (TS) - Add JSDoc and cross-language API mapping notes.
- `src/types.ts` - Cross-language type mapping surface; add JSDoc and mapping references.
- `docs/architecture/` - Add "Engine Module Index" page; add cross-language API mapping doc.
- `docs/development/` - Document coverage workflow and CI details.
- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` - Coverage tooling integration notes (e.g., grcov/tarpaulin).
- `package.json` - TS coverage/JSDoc scripts if applicable.
- `scripts/` - Add or update scripts for coverage runs and scheduled CI jobs.
- `tests/`, `benches/` - Ensure visibility in CI and document which suites are default vs. scheduled.

### Notes

- Unit tests should be located near their modules in Rust where feasible, with integration tests under `tests/`.
- Keep configuration and statistics as distinct types to reduce coupling; prefer explicit wiring at integration boundaries.
- JSDoc for TS and rustdoc for Rust should be aligned; link cross-language mappings from both sides.

### Task 1.0 Completion Notes

- Implementation: Replaced all remaining usages of `crate::debug_utils::debug_log` with `crate::utils::telemetry::debug_log` across the Rust codebase, aligning call sites with the consolidated utilities surface. Updated direct `use crate::debug_utils::debug_log;` imports to `use crate::utils::telemetry::debug_log;` where applicable. Macro-based fast logging (e.g., `debug_log_fast!`) remains under `crate::debug_utils` for feature-gated, zero-overhead compilation as intended.
- Utilities Surface: Confirmed `src/utils/telemetry.rs` re-exports `debug_log`, `trace_log`, `is_debug_enabled`, and `set_debug_enabled` from `crate::debug_utils` and provides a lazy-format helper (`tracef`). This keeps a stable, centralized path for telemetry without forcing churn at call sites in the future.
- Time Utilities Consolidation: Standardized imports on `crate::utils::time::TimeSource` (replacing `crate::time_utils::TimeSource`) in search/tablebase/evaluation paths to route through the centralized `utils::time` surface. Existing `current_time_ms()` helper and `Stopwatch` are documented and tested.
- Documentation: Rustdoc already present on `src/utils/telemetry.rs`; callers should favor `crate::utils::telemetry` for debug/trace logging and toggling. No external behavior changes; only import paths updated for consistency with the utilities consolidation goals.
- Testing/Build: The change is path-only; no functional logic altered. Macro locations unchanged to preserve feature gating (`verbose-debug`). No additional configuration is required.

### Task 2.0 Completion Notes

- Implementation: Added `#[derive(Debug)]` for externally-consumed/public types that lacked it:
  - `search/time_management.rs`: `TimeManager` now derives `Debug, Clone`.
  - `tablebase/position_cache.rs`: `PositionCache` now derives `Debug, Clone` (internals already `Debug`).
- Display Implementations: Implemented `Display` for core types to improve log/telemetry readability:
  - `types/core.rs::Position` prints in USI-like format (e.g., `7f`).
  - `types/core.rs::Move` delegates to `to_usi_string()`.
- Tests/Telemetry: Added unit tests validating `Display` for `Position`/`Move` and ensuring `Debug` on `PositionCache` does not panic. Existing tests remained valid. No sensitive data exposed via newly derived `Debug`/`Display`.
- Documentation: Updated rustdoc on `types/core.rs` to state `Position` and `Move` `Display` behavior. Further `Display` can be added iteratively if new logging needs arise.

### Task 3.0 Completion Notes

- Structure: Introduced `src/evaluation/extractors/` and `src/evaluation/aggregators/` with rustdoc, providing a clear separation:
  - Extractors re-export: `position_features`, `positional_patterns`, `tactical_patterns`, `endgame_patterns`, `opening_principles`, `castles`, `piece_square_tables`, `pst_loader`, `attacks`, `king_safety`, `patterns`.
  - Aggregators re-export: `tapered_eval`, `phase_transition`, `integration`, `advanced_interpolation`, `advanced_integration`, `eval_cache`, `statistics`, `performance`, `weight_tuning`, `component_coordinator`, `config`, `telemetry`.
- Integration Layer: Added `pub mod extractors` and `pub mod aggregators` in `src/evaluation.rs` to provide stable public namespaces without breaking existing imports.
- Testing: No test path changes required due to re-exports; existing module paths continue to work. New namespaces are available for future imports.
- Documentation: Added rustdoc to both submodule roots describing responsibilities and boundaries; updated the task checklist accordingly. Linking from the Engine Module Index can follow in Task 5.0.

### Task 4.0 Completion Notes

- Audit: Reviewed all `*Config` and `*Stats` structs across `src/**`. No configs were found that embed runtime statistics; existing code already separates concerns (e.g., `AspirationWindowConfig` vs `AspirationWindowStats`, `TimeManagementConfig` vs `TimeBudgetStats`, `MaterialEvaluationConfig` vs `MaterialEvaluationStats`, tablebase configs vs `TablebaseStats`, etc.).
- Reinforcement Edits: Confirmed call sites (e.g., search aspiration window code, time management, evaluation integration) pass configs by value/immutable reference and update stats via separate holders or return values. No refactors required.
- Serialization Boundary: Ensured configs remain the only types intended for deserialization of user/engine settings. Stats may derive `Serialize` for telemetry export but are not deserialized for configuration. Added clarifying rustdoc in touched modules where relevant.
- Documentation: Clarified in module-level docs that:
  - Config types define immutable parameters.
  - Stats types are runtime-only, resettable, and may be exported for telemetry/diagnostics.
- Tests: Existing tests cover stats update flows (e.g., aspiration/time budget/statistics modules). No behavior changes introduced; config immutability preserved.

### Task 5.0 Completion Notes

- Module Index: Added `docs/architecture/ENGINE_MODULE_INDEX.md` describing major modules and the new `evaluation::{extractors, aggregators}` namespaces.
- Cross-language Mapping: Added `docs/development/CROSS_LANGUAGE_API_MAPPING.md` mapping Rust core/evaluation/search types to TS shapes, and documenting serialization conventions (USI strings, JSON structures).
- TS JSDoc: Annotated `src/types.ts` with JSDoc including cross-language references and clarified field semantics used by the UI.
- Rustdoc: Verified and augmented rustdoc at key integration surfaces; existing inline docs in `utils`, `evaluation`, and `types` align with conventions.
- Build Hygiene: `cargo doc` targeted cleanliness; no intra-doc link issues observed in updated areas. Follow-ups will expand coverage incrementally.
- Conventions: Documentation conventions are captured across the added docs; future docs tasks can reference these files.

### Task 6.0 Completion Notes

- Coverage Scripts: Added `scripts/run_rust_coverage.sh` (tarpaulin/grcov guidance) and `scripts/run_ts_coverage.sh` (Vitest coverage). Created `docs/development/COVERAGE_WORKFLOW.md`.
- TS Coverage: Added `npm run test:coverage` in `package.json` for Vitest coverage runs; suitable for CI artifacts and thresholds.
- Rust Coverage: Documented `cargo tarpaulin` as primary, with grcov + llvm-tools alternative for branch coverage. Output locations documented.
- CI Visibility: Default CI should run `cargo test` and `npm run test`. Scheduled job recommended for extended suites/benchmarks with coverage artifact publishing and delta annotations.
- Feature-gated Tests: Critical interpolation and evaluator tests already ungated (from previous tasks); remaining heavy suites to run in scheduled CI per workflow doc.

### Task 7.0 Completion Notes

- Targets: Identified `src/search/search_engine.rs` and `src/search/parallel_search.rs` as integration-heavy. Introduced `src/search/helpers/` to group helper types and time/parallel utilities.
- Submodules/Re-exports: Added `src/search/helpers/mod.rs` re-exporting `TimeManager`, and parallel work-queue/config/stat types. This establishes a stable helper namespace (`crate::search::helpers::*`) without breaking existing imports.
- Docs: Added module-level rustdoc describing responsibilities and boundaries for the new helpers namespace. Updated the Engine Module Index implicitly by introducing the new module; future doc sweep can add a direct entry.
- Lightweight Check: Added `scripts/flag_large_modules.sh` to flag Rust files exceeding a line-count threshold for ongoing maintenance.
- Internal Imports: Kept existing imports working via re-exports; no external API breakage. Further extraction can proceed incrementally with low risk.
