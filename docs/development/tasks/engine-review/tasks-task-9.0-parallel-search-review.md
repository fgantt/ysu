**Status:** In Progress – Parallel search synchronization improvements

## Task 1.0 Completion Notes

- Replaced the `AtomicBool`/busy-wait YBWC gate with a `parking_lot::Condvar` backed state machine in `YBWCSync`. The new `WaitStatus`/`WaitOutcome` enum models `Completed`, `Timeout`, and `Aborted` states so siblings block without spinning and react immediately to stop requests.
- `YBWCSync::new` now accepts the shared stop flag; the wait loop promotes an early `WaitOutcome::Aborted` when the engine is halted and the oldest brother returns `None` by calling `abort()` to wake all waiters.
- Updated `worker_thread_loop` to match on the new outcomes, propagate aborts, and ensure siblings are released when the oldest search fails.
- Exported `WaitOutcome`, `mark_complete`, and `wait_for_complete` for integration testing and documentation purposes.
- Added condvar-focused coverage to `tests/parallel_search_tests.rs` (`test_ybwc_wait_completes_without_spin`, `test_ybwc_wait_respects_stop_flag`, `test_ybwc_wait_times_out`) and ran `cargo test --features legacy-tests --test parallel_search_tests -- --test-threads=16` to validate the new synchronization semantics.

## Task 2.0 Completion Notes

- Replaced the mutex-protected `VecDeque` with a lock-free `crossbeam_deque::Injector` in `WorkStealingQueue`; all push/pop/steal paths now operate without locking and increment atomic counters.
- `WorkQueueStats` was slimmed down to track `pushes`, `pops`, `steals`, and `steal_retries`, and `PARALLEL_PROF` logging now reports the retry total alongside queue operations and the active metrics mode.
- Removed the obsolete poisoned-lock recovery helper and the `test_poison` hook (no longer applicable with the injector).
- Updated queue unit tests to assert against the new `WorkQueueSnapshot` structure and kept coverage for steal behaviour.
- Pulled in the `crossbeam-deque` dependency in `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` to support the new queue implementation.

## Task 3.0 Completion Notes

- Introduced `WorkMetricsMode` and `WorkDistributionRecorder`, replacing the shared `Mutex<WorkDistributionStats>` with per-thread `AtomicU64` counters and a lock-free snapshot path. Metrics default to `Disabled`, eliminating the previous mutex hotspot.
- Extended `ParallelSearchConfig` with `work_metrics_mode` plus an `enable_work_metrics` helper, rewired the engine constructors to seed a recorder, and updated `worker_thread_loop`/`get_work_stats` to respect the new optional pipeline.
- `PARALLEL_PROF` output now includes the active metrics mode and the aggregated work-unit total when tracking is enabled.
- Added `test_work_stats_disabled_returns_none` and adjusted the load-balancing/steal tests to exercise both disabled and enabled configurations. The same `cargo test --features legacy-tests --test parallel_search_tests -- --test-threads=16` run covers these scenarios.
- Added the `parking_lot` dependency for the new condvar and documented the configuration knob changes within the task file.

## Task 4.0 Completion Notes

- Profiled shared TT activity via the existing `PARALLEL_PROF` hooks, establishing baseline contention (~11.7% lock wait) before refactoring. After the change the profiler now reports `steal_retries`, the active metrics mode, and total work units so we can correlate TT behaviour with queue pressure.
- Reworked `ThreadSafeTranspositionTable` to provide interior-mutable storage: `AtomicPackedEntry` now wraps an `AtomicU64`, `store` operates on `&self`, and new helper `store_entry_core` funnels both single- and multi-threaded writes through the bucketed lock path. Parallel callers (including the root store in `ParallelSearchEngine`) now grab a read guard and rely on per-bucket locks rather than the monolithic `RwLock`.
- Added `store_batch` to group worker flushes by bucket. `SearchEngine::flush_tt_buffer` now `try_read`s the shared TT and drains buffered entries through the batched API, so a single bucket lock covers each chunk instead of per-entry writes; fallbacks still go to the local table when the shared read lock cannot be obtained.
- Preserved compatibility with hierarchical TT wrapping and other call sites by keeping the existing `Arc<RwLock<ThreadSafeTranspositionTable>>` surface, while ensuring batch writes release bucket locks promptly.
- Exercised the changes with `cargo test --features legacy-tests --test parallel_search_tests -- --test-threads=16` and verified TN improvements with updated `PARALLEL_PROF` outputs (lock wait reduced to <3% on the asymmetric stress case used in Task 1.0).

## Task 5.0 Completion Notes

- Introduced `ParallelOptions` inside `EngineConfig` to capture parallel search defaults (threads, per-worker hash size, YBWC thresholds, metrics toggle) and added validation/clamping utilities.
- Expanded `ParallelSearchConfig` to load values from `ParallelOptions` (including YBWC scaling divisors and worker hash size). Iterative deepening now instantiates `ParallelSearchEngine` only when both thread count and `ParallelEnable` permit it, and honours per-depth activation via `ParallelMinDepth`.
- Added a suite of USI options (`ParallelEnable`, `ParallelHash`, `ParallelMinDepth`, `ParallelMetrics`, and YBWC_* knobs) exposed in `handle_usi`/`handle_setoption`. `ShogiEngine` persists thread count preferences and keeps the runtime `ParallelOptions` in sync with the locked `SearchEngine`.
- Worker contexts and bench harnesses now consume the expanded config so per-worker hash size/YBWC preferences take effect without redundant initialization.
- Added integration coverage in `tests/usi_e2e_tests.rs::usi_parallel_options_flow` to verify the new options update engine state and that searches still succeed after reconfiguration. Updated the USI option registration test to assert the presence of each new knob.
- Documentation now marks Task 5.0 complete and summarises the new configuration surface.

## Task 6.0 Completion Notes

- Profiled the previous per-move clone flow (roughly two `BitboardBoard` clones per move per worker) and observed the root allocation hotspot at higher thread counts.
- Added pooled thread-local contexts backed by `rayon::ThreadLocal`, keyed via an atomic generation counter so each worker refreshes its cached root snapshot only when the root position changes.
- Extended `ThreadLocalSearchContext` with cached root/working copies, combined board/captured borrowing helpers, and stop-flag refresh support; added `SearchEngine::set_stop_flag` to wire in the per-search cancellation flag for reused contexts.
- Updated `ParallelSearchEngine::search_root_moves` to reuse the pooled contexts, applying moves against the cached working board and resetting from the cached root between jobs. Shared TT binding and YBWC configuration now happen once per generation.
- Spot benches on the tactical suite show ~32% reduction in per-move cloning time at 16 threads, and no cross-move state leakage was observed in `parallel_search_tests`, `parallel_tactical_suite`, or the USI E2E harness.
