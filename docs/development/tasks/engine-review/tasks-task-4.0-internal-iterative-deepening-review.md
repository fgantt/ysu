**Generated:** December 2024  
**Status:** In Progress - Tasks document for Internal Iterative Deepening improvements

**Task 1.0 Completion Notes:**
- Added `total_search_time_ms` field to `IIDStats` struct in `src/types.rs` to track actual total search time
- Updated `IterativeDeepening::search()` method to:
  * Reset `total_search_time_ms` to 0 at the start of each new search
  * Record start time using `TimeSource::now()` at search entry point
  * Calculate total search time at search exit point using `start_time.elapsed_ms()`
  * Store total search time in `search_engine.iid_stats.total_search_time_ms`
  * Handle both normal completion and fallback move paths
- Removed placeholder `total_search_time_ms = 1000` from `get_iid_performance_metrics()` method
- Modified `get_iid_performance_metrics()` to use actual tracked time from `self.iid_stats.total_search_time_ms`
- Verified overhead percentage calculation is correct: `(iid_time_ms / total_search_time_ms) * 100`
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/iid_tests.rs`:
  * `test_iid_stats_total_search_time_tracking()` - Verifies field initialization, setting, and reset
  * `test_iid_overhead_percentage_calculation()` - Tests overhead calculation accuracy with various scenarios including edge cases (zero total time, typical 5-15% range)
  * `test_get_iid_performance_metrics_uses_actual_time()` - Verifies `get_iid_performance_metrics()` uses actual tracked time instead of placeholder
- All tests passing and verify correct behavior:
  * Total search time correctly initialized to 0 and tracked across searches
  * Overhead percentage calculation accurate (tested with 10%, 15%, 25% scenarios)
  * Edge cases handled correctly (zero total time returns 0% overhead)
  * Performance metrics now use actual search time data
- Overhead tracking now provides accurate measurements for IID performance analysis
- Performance reports will now reflect actual IID overhead percentage instead of placeholder values
- Changes maintain backward compatibility - existing code continues to work, just with accurate data

**Task 2.0 Completion Notes:**
- Changed `perform_iid_search()` return type from `Option<Move>` to `(i32, Option<Move>)` to include the IID score
- Modified `perform_iid_search()` to track best move during search by searching moves individually instead of relying solely on TT
- Removed dependency on `iid_score > alpha` condition - IID now provides move ordering even when score doesn't beat alpha
- Implemented fallback logic: prefers TT move if available and valid, otherwise uses tracked best move from search
- Added verification that IID move is in legal moves list before using it in move ordering
- Updated `negamax_with_context()` to receive IID move from tuple return value: `let (iid_score_result, iid_move_result) = self.perform_iid_search(...)`
- Removed old TT-only move extraction logic - move is now tracked during search with TT as fallback
- Added statistics tracking fields to `IIDStats`:
  * `iid_move_extracted_from_tt` - tracks when move comes from transposition table
  * `iid_move_extracted_from_tracked` - tracks when move comes from tracked best move during search
- Added debug logging for IID move extraction showing score and move found
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/iid_tests.rs`:
  * `test_iid_move_extraction_returns_tuple()` - verifies new return type
  * `test_iid_move_extraction_works_without_alpha_beating()` - tests move extraction works even when score doesn't beat alpha
  * `test_iid_move_verification_in_legal_moves()` - verifies returned move is in legal moves list
  * `test_iid_statistics_tracking_tt_vs_tracked()` - tests statistics tracking for extraction methods
  * `test_iid_move_none_when_no_moves_found()` - tests graceful handling when no move found
  * `test_iid_stats_new_fields_initialized()` - verifies new stats fields initialize correctly
  * `test_iid_stats_reset_includes_new_fields()` - verifies reset() properly resets new fields
- Updated all existing tests to use new tuple return type
- Reviewed `board.clone()` usage at line 3102 - confirmed necessary to avoid modifying original board state during IID search
- IID move extraction now more reliable and provides better move ordering by tracking moves during search rather than relying solely on TT
- Created comprehensive performance benchmarks in `benches/iid_move_extraction_benchmarks.rs`:
  * `benchmark_move_extraction_methods()` - Compares tracked move extraction performance with statistics tracking
  * `benchmark_iid_overhead_verification()` - Measures overhead by comparing IID enabled vs disabled search times
  * `benchmark_move_extraction_success_rates()` - Tracks success rates at different IID depths
  * `benchmark_extraction_performance_comparison()` - Performance comparison with move ordering simulation
  * `benchmark_comprehensive_overhead_analysis()` - Comprehensive overhead analysis across multiple search depths
- Benchmarks verify that move extraction overhead is minimal (<1% target) and provide metrics for TT-based vs tracked move extraction

**Task 11.0 Completion Notes:**
- Research completed (Tasks 11.1, 11.4, 11.6):
  * Game phase-based depth adjustment: Opening positions benefit from deeper IID (more tactical), endgame benefits from shallower IID (faster, more precise)
  * Material-based depth scaling: Material-rich positions benefit from deeper IID search for better move ordering
  * Time-based depth adjustment: When time is low, shallower IID prevents time overhead
- Implemented game phase detection in IID depth calculation (Task 11.2):
  * Uses existing `get_game_phase()` method which determines phase based on material count
  * Game phase is detected in `apply_advanced_depth_strategies()` method
- Implemented game phase-based depth adjustment (Task 11.3):
  * Added `game_phase_opening_multiplier`, `game_phase_middlegame_multiplier`, `game_phase_endgame_multiplier` configuration options
  * Depth is multiplied by the appropriate multiplier based on game phase
  * Opening: typically 1.2x (deeper IID), Middlegame: 1.0x (default), Endgame: 0.8x (shallower IID)
- Implemented material-based depth adjustment (Task 11.5):
  * Added `material_depth_multiplier` and `material_threshold_for_adjustment` configuration options
  * When material count exceeds threshold, depth is multiplied by material multiplier
  * Deeper IID in material-rich positions (more pieces = more complex move ordering)
- Implemented time-based depth adjustment (Task 11.7):
  * Added `time_depth_multiplier` and `time_threshold_for_adjustment` configuration options
  * When remaining time percentage is below threshold, depth is multiplied by time multiplier
  * Shallower IID when time is low to prevent excessive time overhead
- Added configuration options (Task 11.8):
  * `enable_game_phase_based_adjustment: bool` (default: false)
  * `enable_material_based_adjustment: bool` (default: false)
  * `enable_time_based_adjustment: bool` (default: false)

  * `material_threshold_for_adjustment: u8` (default: 20 pieces)
  * `time_depth_multiplier: f64` (default: 1.0)
  * `time_threshold_for_adjustment: f64` (default: 0.15 = 15% remaining)

  * `game_phase_endgame_adjustments: u64` - times endgame phase adjustment was applied
  * Added `update_advanced_strategy_effectiveness()` method to track effectiveness when IID moves are successful
- Implemented `apply_advanced_depth_strategies()` method:
  * Applies all enabled advanced strategies sequentially to adjust IID depth
  * Strategies are applied as multipliers to the base depth
  * Final depth is clamped to valid range (1 to dynamic_max_depth)
  * Integrated into `calculate_iid_depth()` to apply after base depth calculation
- Updated `calculate_iid_depth()` signature:
  * Added optional `start_time: Option<&TimeSource>` and `time_limit_ms: Option<u32>` parameters
  * Required for time-based adjustment, but optional for backward compatibility
  * All call sites updated to pass time parameters where available

  * Uses conditional debug flags (`IID_DEPTH_ADVANCED`)
- Integration with existing features:
  * Advanced strategies work with all existing depth strategies (Fixed, Relative, Adaptive, Dynamic)
  * Strategies are applied after base depth calculation, so they work regardless of base strategy
  * All strategies integrate with existing complexity-based adjustments
