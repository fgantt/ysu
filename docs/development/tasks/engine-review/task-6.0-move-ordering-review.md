### 6.2 Verify Capture Ordering (MVV/LVA) Effectiveness

**Location:** `src/search/move_ordering.rs`, lines 3517-3529

**Implementation Quality:** ✅ **Excellent**

**Current Implementation:**
```rust
fn score_capture_move_inline(&self, move_: &Move) -> i32 {
    if let Some(captured_piece) = &move_.captured_piece {
        // MVV-LVA: Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Attacker
        let victim_value = captured_piece.piece_type.base_value();
        let attacker_value = move_.piece_type.base_value();
        
        // Scale the score based on the exchange value
        let exchange_value = victim_value - attacker_value;
        self.config.weights.capture_weight + exchange_value / 10
    } else {
        0
    }
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Correctly implements MVV/LVA (Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Attacker)
- ✅ Calculates exchange value (victim - attacker)
- ✅ Uses configurable weight for capture bonus
- ✅ Properly handles non-capture moves (returns 0)
- ✅ Inlined for performance optimization

**MVV/LVA Logic:**
- **Victim Value:** Value of the captured piece
- **Attacker Value:** Value of the attacking piece
- **Exchange Value:** `victim_value - attacker_value`
- **Score:** `capture_weight + exchange_value / 10`

**Integration:**
- Used in `score_move()` for capture moves (line 2770)
- Integrated with SEE calculation (when SEE is enabled)
- Properly prioritized in move ordering hierarchy

**Effectiveness:**
- MVV/LVA is a proven heuristic for capture ordering
- The implementation correctly prioritizes good captures (high-value victims, low-value attackers)
- The scaling factor (division by 10) ensures reasonable score ranges
- Configurable weight allows tuning for different playing styles

**Statistics Tracking:**
- Capture moves tracked in `heuristic_stats.capture_stats`
- Statistics include applications, best move contributions, score contributions, execution time

**Recommendations:**
1. ✅ MVV/LVA implementation is correct and effective
2. Consider adding SEE (Static Exchange Evaluation) for more accurate capture ordering (SEE implementation exists but is incomplete)
3. Consider different scaling factors for different game phases

### 6.3 Check Killer Move Usage and Effectiveness

**Location:** `src/search/move_ordering.rs`, lines 4101-4377

**Implementation Quality:** ✅ **Excellent**

**Current Implementation:**

**Killer Move Storage:**
- Stored by depth in `HashMap<u8, Vec<Move>>` (line 1553)
- Configurable maximum moves per depth (default: 2)
- Depth-aware management via `set_current_depth()` (line 4107)

**Key Methods:**
1. **`add_killer_move()`** (lines 4128-4153): Adds a move that caused a beta cutoff
   - Checks for duplicates before adding
   - Maintains FIFO order (removes oldest if limit exceeded)
   - Updates statistics

2. **`score_killer_move()`** (lines 4120-4122): Returns configurable killer weight

3. **`is_killer_move()`** (lines 4159-4167): Checks if move is a killer move at current depth

4. **`get_killer_moves()`** (lines 4173-4183): Retrieves killer moves for a depth

**Integration:**
- Used in `order_moves_with_all_heuristics()` (line 5927)
- Prioritized after IID moves and PV moves, before history heuristic
- Depth-aware lookup ensures relevant killer moves are used

**Effectiveness:**
- ✅ Killer moves are stored at the correct depth
- ✅ Properly integrated into move ordering hierarchy
- ✅ Statistics tracking for hit rate monitoring
- ✅ Configurable weight allows tuning

**Statistics Tracking:**
- `killer_move_hits` - Number of times a killer move was found
- `killer_move_misses` - Number of times no killer move was found
- `killer_move_hit_rate` - Percentage of successful killer lookups
- `killer_moves_stored` - Total number of killer moves stored

**Performance:**
- O(1) lookup for killer moves at a specific depth
- Efficient storage with HashMap
- Memory usage tracked and optimized

**Recommendations:**
1. ✅ Killer move implementation is correct and effective
2. Consider using counter-move heuristic (killer moves for opponent's moves)
3. Consider aging killer moves (reducing weight over time)
4. Consider different killer move counts for different depths

---

### 6.4 Assess History Heuristic Implementation

**Location:** `src/search/move_ordering.rs`, lines 4379-4559

**Implementation Quality:** ✅ **Excellent**

**Current Implementation:**

**History Table Structure:**
- Stored in `HashMap<(PieceType, Position, Position), u32>` (line 1560)
- Key: `(piece_type, from_square, to_square)`
- Value: History score (accumulated bonus for successful moves)

**Key Methods:**
1. **`update_history_score()`** (lines 4406-4432): Updates history score when move causes cutoff or improves alpha
   - Bonus: `depth * depth` (quadratic depth bonus)
   - Prevents overflow with max_history_score limit
   - Automatic aging support (configurable frequency)

2. **`score_history_move()`** (lines 4385-4399): Scores a move using history heuristic
   - Scales history score by history_weight / 1000
   - Returns 0 if move not in history table

3. **`age_history_table()`** (lines 4450-4472): Ages history scores to prevent overflow
   - Multiplies all scores by aging factor (default: 0.95)
   - Removes entries with zero scores
   - Can be triggered automatically or manually

**Effectiveness:**
- ✅ Correctly accumulates bonuses for successful moves
- ✅ Depth-squared bonus gives more weight to deeper cutoffs
- ✅ Automatic aging prevents overflow and gives more weight to recent moves
- ✅ Properly integrated into move ordering hierarchy

**Aging Mechanism:**
- Configurable aging factor (default: 0.95)
- Automatic aging based on update counter
- Aging frequency configurable
- Removes zero-score entries to save memory

**Statistics Tracking:**
- `history_hits` - Number of successful history lookups
- `history_misses` - Number of failed history lookups
- `history_hit_rate` - Percentage of successful history lookups
- `history_updates` - Number of history score updates
- `history_aging_operations` - Number of aging operations performed

**Performance:**
- O(1) lookup for history scores
- Efficient HashMap storage
- Memory usage tracked and optimized

**Recommendations:**
1. ✅ History heuristic implementation is correct and effective
2. Consider using relative history (history[from][to] instead of history[piece][from][to])
3. Consider different aging factors for different game phases
4. Consider using history table for quiet moves only (not captures)
5. Consider adding counter-move history (separate table for opponent moves)

**PV Move Retrieval:**
- Uses transposition table to find best move for position
- Caches PV moves in `pv_move_cache: HashMap<u64, Option<Move>>` (line 1548)
- Position hash calculated via `hash_calculator.get_position_hash()` (line 3899)

**Key Methods:**
1. **`get_pv_move()`** (lines 3893-3922): Retrieves PV move from transposition table
   - Checks cache first (fast lookup)
   - Queries transposition table if cache miss
   - Caches result for future lookups
   - Handles null transposition table reference

2. **`score_pv_move()`** (lines 3885-3887): Returns configurable PV move weight

3. **`order_moves_with_pv()`** (lines 4025-4059): Orders moves with PV prioritization
   - Gets PV move for position
   - Scores moves with PV consideration
   - Sorts by score (PV moves get highest priority)

**Integration:**
- Used in `order_moves_with_all_heuristics()` (line 5925)
- Highest priority after IID moves
- Properly integrated with transposition table
- Depth-aware lookup (uses position hash which includes depth)

**Effectiveness:**
- ✅ Correctly retrieves PV moves from transposition table
- ✅ Properly prioritizes PV moves in ordering
- ✅ Caching reduces transposition table lookup overhead
- ✅ Statistics tracking for hit rate monitoring

**Statistics Tracking:**
- `pv_move_hits` - Number of successful PV move lookups

- `pv_move_hit_rate` - Percentage of successful PV lookups
- `tt_lookups` - Number of transposition table lookups
- `tt_hits` - Number of successful transposition table hits

**Performance:**
- O(1) cache lookup for PV moves
- O(1) transposition table lookup (if cache miss)
- Efficient caching reduces TT overhead

**Recommendations:**
1. ✅ PV move ordering integration is correct and effective

### 6.9 Coordinate Analysis with LMR, IID, and Search Core Reviews

**Integration Points:**

**1. IID Integration (Task 4.0):**
- ✅ IID move is given highest priority in move ordering (line 5973-5979)
- ✅ IID move integration is properly implemented
- ✅ Statistics track IID move position in ordered list (lines 4126-4140 in search_engine.rs)
- ✅ Cache is skipped when IID move is present (line 5897) - ensures IID move is always prioritized

**Analysis:**
- IID integration is excellent. The IID move gets maximum score (`i32::MAX`) to ensure it's always searched first.
- Statistics tracking verifies IID move is properly prioritized.
- Cache skipping ensures IID move is not missed even if ordering was cached before.

**2. LMR Integration (Task 3.0):**
- ✅ Move ordering affects LMR effectiveness (better ordering = better LMR)
- ✅ LMR exemptions (captures, checks, promotions) align with move ordering priorities
- ✅ Move ordering statistics track cutoffs after LMR threshold (MoveOrderingEffectivenessStats)

**Analysis:**
- Move ordering is critical for LMR effectiveness. Better ordering means more early cutoffs, which means LMR can be more aggressive.
- The coordination between move ordering and LMR is implicit but effective. Early-ordered moves are less likely to be reduced.
- Statistics tracking helps identify if move ordering needs improvement for LMR effectiveness.

**3. Search Core Integration (Task 1.0):**
- ✅ Move ordering is called at every search node (line 4123 in search_engine.rs)
- ✅ Properly integrated with PVS search
- ✅ Statistics track ordering effectiveness per search node

**Analysis:**
- Move ordering is well-integrated with the search core. It's called efficiently and doesn't block search.
- Caching reduces overhead significantly.
- Statistics provide insights into search efficiency.

**Coordination Improvements:**

1. **Move Ordering for LMR:**
   - Consider using move ordering quality to adjust LMR reduction amounts
   - If move ordering is very effective (high early cutoff rate), LMR can be more aggressive
   - If move ordering is less effective, LMR should be more conservative

2. **IID Move Quality:**
   - Track IID move effectiveness (how often IID move is actually the best move)
   - Use this to tune IID trigger conditions
   - Consider skipping IID if move ordering is already very good

3. **Search Core Coordination:**
   - Consider using move ordering effectiveness to adjust search depth
   - If move ordering is very effective, can search deeper with same time budget
   - If move ordering is less effective, may need more time for same depth
